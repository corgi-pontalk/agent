Alice: Bob, guess what? I have an incredible product for you!
Bob: Oh, Alice? What secret offer do you have this time? Is it another "guaranteed success" juice blender?
Alice: No, no! This is better! It's my legendary 'Lucky Charm Rock'! It's one of a kind.
Bob: Your... rock? How much does this product cost? Is there a discount for friends?
Alice: For you, Bob, a special price of only20! And it's usually50! That's a huge sale!
Bob:20 for a rock? Alice, it looks like a regular rock from my garden. And it has a dent.
Alice: That's a "character mark"! It proves its age and wisdom. It brings good fortune!
Bob: Hmm, I'm not sure I'm the right customer for a dented, wise rock. What if I want to return it?
Alice: No returns! But I can give you a deal on a second, slightly smaller, 'Luckier Charm Pebble'!
Bob: You're really trying to sell this, aren't you? What's your target audience for these? Rocks?
Alice: People who need luck, Bob! Imagine the value!
Bob: I see. So, if I buy it, do I get a receipt? For my tax records, you know.
Alice: Of course! A handwritten one! So, do we have a deal? You'll be the happiest customer!
Bob: Okay, okay, you drive a hard bargain, Alice. But only if you throw in a free hug.
Alice: Deal! You're an amazing customer! And a cheap date for rocks.
