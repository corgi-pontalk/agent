Alice : Hey Bob, still staring at that chemistry textbook? You look like you just saw a ghost! Bob : Alice! Oh, it's worse than a ghost. It's... atoms! They're everywhere, and I don't get them. Alice : Haha! Well, you _are_ made of atoms, you know. Everything is! Bob : So, this coffee cup? Atoms. My sandwich? Atoms. Even my confusion? Atoms? Alice : Exactly! Think of atoms as tiny, tiny building blocks. Super, super small. Bob : Okay, building blocks. Like Lego? Can I build a house with them? Alice : You could, but it would be the smallest house ever! When atoms join together, they make molecules. Bob : Molecules! Is that why water is H2O? Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom make a water molecule? Alice : Ding ding ding! You got it! That's a molecule of water. Bob : So, air is also molecules? Like, a bunch of different atoms dancing around? Alice : Pretty much! Mostly nitrogen and oxygen molecules. They're just floating everywhere. Bob : Wow. So, I'm breathing nitrogen and oxygen molecules right now. And my brain is thinking about atoms... which are also atoms. My head hurts. Alice : Don't worry, Bob. Chemistry isn't so scary once you understand the basics. It's just about what everything is made of! Bob : So, if I understand chemistry, does that mean I can finally turn my homework into pizza? Alice : Hmm, not quite, but you might understand _why_ pizza tastes so good! It's all chemistry!
