        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, this commercial is playing for the tenth time today! My TV knows I hate this brand.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> (chuckles) Alice, it's not just your TV. Ads are everywhere! Look at my phone, another pop-up ad for cat food. I don't even have a cat!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! They follow us. Yesterday, I looked at a pair of shoes online for five seconds, and now every website shows me those shoes. It’s like they're haunting me.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, I know that feeling! It’s like a digital ghost. Do you think they actually work?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Well, sometimes. I did buy that super soft blanket after seeing a cute animal in the ad. It was very persuasive.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Ha! So you're saying ads are evil <em>but</em> effective?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Maybe a little. Especially those funny ones. Remember the ad with the talking baby selling insurance? That was hilarious.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, yes! That baby was a marketing genius. I almost called them!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> See? Humor can make an ad memorable. But most of them are just... loud.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> True. And repetitive. I wish there was an "ad mute" button for real life.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Or an "ad skip" button for billboards. Imagine driving without seeing a giant burger!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> (laughs) A peaceful drive! But then how would we know about new burgers? It's a tricky balance.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Maybe. But I think I prefer fewer burgers and more peace.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> So, no more cute animal ads for you?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Okay, <em>some</em> cute animal ads are allowed. They're an exception!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Advertising is a way for companies to tell people about their products or services. It tries to get you to buy things or know about a brand. Today, ads are everywhere! You see them on TV, hear them on the radio, find them in magazines, and especially online – on websites, social media, and even in apps.</p>
    <p>Online advertising is very popular because it can target specific people based on their interests. For example, if you search for "shoes," you might start seeing many shoe ads. While ads can be useful for discovering new things, they can also be annoying when they are too frequent or not relevant to you.</p>

    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Present Simple vs. Present Continuous</strong>
                <p>The <em>Present Simple</em> describes habits, routines, facts, and general truths. (e.g., "Ads <strong>are</strong> everywhere." "My TV <strong>knows</strong>.")</p>
                <p>The <em>Present Continuous</em> describes actions happening right now or temporary situations. (e.g., "This commercial <strong>is playing</strong>." "Every website <strong>shows</strong> me those shoes" - *here 'shows' is simple present for a regular occurrence, but if it were 'is showing' it would be continuous*).</p>
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> "This commercial <strong>is playing</strong> right now, and I <strong>hate</strong> it."</span></li>
            <li><strong>Using "Like" for Comparison</strong>
                <p>We use "like" to show that one thing is similar to another thing or to give an example. It means "similar to" or "as if".</p>
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> "It’s <strong>like</strong> they're haunting me." (Meaning: It's similar to being haunted.)</span>
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> "It’s <strong>like</strong> a digital ghost." (Meaning: It's similar to a digital ghost.)</span></li>
            <li><strong>Modal Verb "Can" for Possibility or Ability</strong>
                <p>"Can" is a modal verb used to express ability, permission, or possibility.</p>
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> "Humor <strong>can</strong> make an ad memorable." (Meaning: It is possible for humor to make an ad memorable.)</span></li>
