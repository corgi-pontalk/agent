    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Oh, hey Bob, you look chipper. I'm over here contemplating my life choices.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Alice! What's got you down? Did your favourite coffee shop run out of oat milk again?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Worse. I just spent an hour looking at apartment listings in Singapore. My future home might just be a very fancy cardboard box, or maybe a really luxurious tent.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Haha, tell me about it! The real estate market in Asia is absolutely bonkers right now. Especially places like Seoul and Tokyo. It's like houses are made of gold bricks.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> "Bonkers" is an understatement. I saw a studio flat in Hong Kong that was basically a glorified shoe box for the price of a small island. Complete with a miniature kitchen that fits one noodle cup.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> It's like property values are operating on a different planet. Is it all foreign investment driving it, do you think? Or perhaps magical leprechauns buying up everything?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Partially, yeah. And low interest rates in some places. Everyone's scrambling to get a piece of the pie before it's completely out of reach for us mere mortals.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> I heard somewhere that even in cities like Bangkok, prices for prime locations are skyrocketing. Makes you wonder if there's a bubble forming, ready to burst spectacularly.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Definitely feels like it. I mean, who can afford these places? Not us, that's for sure. My dream of a spacious apartment with a balcony is slowly morphing into a shared bunk bed in a co-living space, if I'm lucky.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Don't give up! Maybe we should start a trend: micro-living in a refurbished shipping container. Very eco-chic, and probably still unaffordable.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Or just buy a tiny island somewhere in the Pacific. Cheaper, better views... until the rising sea levels make it disappear. Then it's an underwater investment.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> I'm serious, though. It's tough for our generation. My parents bought their first house for less than my current student loan debt! They practically got a palace for pennies.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Right? It's a whole different ballgame. I just wish there was some stability, some... *affordability*. A magical unicorn that makes house prices reasonable.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Well, if all else fails, I've heard the moon has excellent long-term investment potential. No capital gains tax yet! And the views are out of this world.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> (Sighs dramatically) Bob, sometimes I wonder if you're trying to make me laugh or cry. Let's just go get some coffee and pretend we own a skyscraper in the most exclusive part of Tokyo.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The real estate market in many parts of Asia has been characterized by significant growth and high demand in recent years. Major urban centers like Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo, and Hong Kong continue to see robust property markets, often driven by factors such as strong economic growth, rapid urbanization, foreign investment, and limited land supply in prime areas. This has led to skyrocketing prices, making affordability a major concern for local residents, especially young people and first-time homebuyers.</p>
    <p>Government policies, including cooling measures like increased stamp duties and tightened lending restrictions, have been implemented in various countries to curb speculative buying and stabilize markets. Despite these efforts, demand often outstrips supply, particularly in the luxury and high-end segments. While some markets have shown signs of moderation or correction in specific sectors (e.g., certain cities in mainland China due to policy shifts), the general trend for prime locations across many Asian hubs remains one of upward pressure on prices, fueled by both local and international capital seeking stable investment opportunities.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "I've been looking")</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used to describe an action that started in the past and is still continuing in the present, or has just finished but has a clear result in the present. It emphasizes the duration of the action.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing (present participle)</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "I just <strong>spent</strong> an hour looking at apartment listings..." (Alice) - *Though not explicitly Present Perfect Continuous, this leads to the result of her current state.* A better example: "I've <strong>been looking</strong> at apartment listings all morning, and my head hurts." (Implied in Alice's statement.)</li>
            <li><strong>Further Example:</strong> "We've <strong>been discussing</strong> real estate trends for over an hour." (The discussion started an hour ago and is still ongoing.)</li>
            <li><strong>Further Example:</strong> "It's <strong>been raining</strong> all day." (The rain started in the morning and hasn't stopped.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It often answers the question "How long?" or explains the cause of a present situation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Speculation (e.g., "might be", "could be", "must be")</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>Modal verbs are used to express varying degrees of certainty or possibility about present or future situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Might / May / Could:</strong> Express possibility or uncertainty (less strong than 'must').
                <br><span class="example-sentence">"My future home <strong>might just be</strong> a very fancy cardboard box." (Alice is not certain, it's a possibility.)</span>
                <br><span class="example-sentence">"There <strong>could be</strong> a bubble forming." (It's a possibility, but not definite.)</span></li>
            <li><strong>Must:</strong> Expresses strong probability or logical deduction.
                <br><span class="example-sentence">"He <strong>must be</strong> very rich to afford that penthouse." (A logical conclusion based on high prices.)</span></li>
            <li><strong>Should:</strong> Expresses expectation or what is probable, given the circumstances.
                <br><span class="example-sentence">"Prices <strong>should stabilize</strong> soon, but I'm not optimistic." (An expectation, but with doubt.)</span></li>
        </ul>
