        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey, Bob! You look like you just won the lottery. What's up?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Not the lottery, but I met someone really interesting yesterday.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, really? Tell me everything!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, I was at "The Daily Grind" coffee shop, trying to look cool while waiting for my oat milk latte.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ha! Good luck with that. You usually just look confused by the menu.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hey! Anyway, a new barista started, and she, uh, accidentally spilled a whole cup of coffee all over my brand-new shirt.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Classic Bob! What did you do? Did you panic?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I just laughed and said, "Looks like we're off to a *splashy* start!" She thought it was pretty funny.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Wow, smooth! Did you at least get her name after the coffee shower?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yep! Her name is Maya. She's really friendly and apologized a million times.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> That's great! So, are you going back for more coffee... or more Maya? Be honest.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Definitely both! She actually gave me a free coffee coupon for next time, plus a discount on a new shirt.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Aha! That's a good sign. Maybe you should ask her out for a *dry* coffee sometime.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Maybe I will! It's nice to meet new people, even if it involves an unexpected coffee bath.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Totally! You never know who you'll meet, or how. Maybe next time you'll meet someone doing laundry.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>"Meeting new people" is a common and exciting part of life! It means getting to know someone you haven't met before. This can happen anywhere: at school, work, a coffee shop, a party, or even online. It might feel a little scary at first, but it's a great way to make new friends, learn new things, and expand your world. People often use simple questions like "What's your name?" or "Where are you from?" to start a conversation. Sometimes, like in Bob's story, an unexpected event can be the start of a new connection!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. The Simple Past Tense</h3>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> We use the simple past tense to talk about actions or situations that happened and finished in the past.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>For <strong>regular verbs</strong>, we usually add "-ed" to the base form (e.g., <em>walk</em> &rarr; <em>walked</em>, <em>start</em> &rarr; <em>started</em>, <em>apologize</em> &rarr; <em>apologized</em>).</li>
                <li>For <strong>irregular verbs</strong>, the form changes (e.g., <em>meet</em> &rarr; <em>met</em>, <em>spill</em> &rarr; <em>spilled</em>, <em>get</em> &rarr; <em>got</em>, <em>give</em> &rarr; <em>gave</em>, <em>think</em> &rarr; <em>thought</em>, <em>say</em> &rarr; <em>said</em>, <em>do</em> &rarr; <em>did</em>).</li>
                <li>To make <strong>questions</strong>, we use <code>Did + subject + base form of verb</code> (e.g., "Did you <strong>get</strong> her name?").</li>
                <li>To make <strong>negative sentences</strong>, we use <code>did not (didn't) + base form of verb</code> (e.g., "I didn't <strong>panic</strong>.").</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul class="example">
                <li>"I <strong>met</strong> someone really interesting yesterday." (<code>meet</code> &rarr; <code>met</code>)</li>
                <li>"She accidentally <strong>spilled</strong> a whole cup of coffee." (<code>spill</code> &rarr; <code>spilled</code>)</li>
                <li>"What <strong>did</strong> you <strong>do</strong>?" (<code>do</code> in question form)</li>
                <li>"She <strong>thought</strong> it was pretty funny." (<code>think</code> &rarr; <code>thought</code>)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. The Verb "To Be" (Present and Past)</h3>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The verb "to be" is one of the most common verbs in English and is used to describe states, identities, and locations.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works (Present Tense):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I <strong>am</strong></li>
                <li>You/We/They <strong>are</strong></li>
                <li>He/She/It <strong>is</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>How it works (Past Tense):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I/He/She/It <strong>was</strong></li>
                <li>You/We/They <strong>were</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul class="example">
                <li>"What'<strong>s</strong> (What <strong>is</strong>) up?" (Present)</li>
                <li>"Her name <strong>is</strong> Maya." (Present)</li>
                <li>"She'<strong>s</strong> (She <strong>is</strong>) really friendly." (Present)</li>
                <li>"I <strong>was</strong> at 'The Daily Grind' coffee shop." (Past)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Asking Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>What it is:</strong> We ask questions to get information.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yes/No Questions (with "Did" for simple past):</strong> <code>Did + subject + base verb?</code>
                    <ul class="example">
                        <li>"<strong>Did</strong> you <strong>get</strong> her name?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wh- Questions (What, Where, Who, When, Why, How):</strong> <code>Wh-word + (auxiliary verb) + subject + main verb?</code>
                    <ul class="example">
                        <li>"<strong>What's</strong> up?" (What is up?)</li>
                        <li>"<strong>What</strong> did you do?"</li>
                    </ul>
