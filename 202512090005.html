    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Hey, Bob, what's got you so engrossed in your wrist?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! Just checking my post-run stats. My new smartwatch is practically a life coach!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> A life coach? Sounds intense. What exactly does it tell you?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Everything! Heart rate zones, VO2 max, recovery time, even suggests when I should hydrate. It's revolutionary!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> So you're saying it knows you better than you know yourself?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Sometimes, yes! This morning it told me my 'performance readiness' was 72%. I almost didn't go for my run, but then it nudged me, saying 'optimal stress levels detected for a light jog'.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> It *nudged* you? Sounds less like a coach and more like a benevolent overlord.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Haha! It just wants me to be my best self! And check this out – my smart insoles track my foot strike and tell me if I'm pronating too much.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Smart insoles? Next you'll tell me your socks have Wi-Fi.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Actually, there are smart socks that monitor muscle activity! But I haven't splurged on those yet. I'm saving up for a smart water bottle that reminds me to drink.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> A water bottle that *reminds* you? Bob, do you trust this tech implicitly?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Well, mostly. Yesterday, my fitness tracker vibrated furiously during my lunch, telling me I needed to 'close my activity rings' immediately. Turns out I'd just been vigorously stirring my coffee.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> See! It's not infallible! What if it tells you to run a marathon when you're clearly unwell?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> It has a 'sick day' mode! And it suggests meditation if my stress levels are high. It's surprisingly comprehensive.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Okay, I'm intrigued. Maybe I should get one to monitor my 'couch potato activity' levels.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-exchange">
        <span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Absolutely, Alice! It could revolutionize your Netflix bingeing! You'll know exactly how many calories you're burning reaching for the remote.

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Sports technology and wearables have transformed how athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and even casual users monitor and enhance their physical activity and health. Once confined to professional sports, these devices are now mainstream, offering a plethora of data points right from our wrists, shoes, or clothing.</p>
    <p>Modern smartwatches and fitness trackers are at the forefront, providing real-time metrics like heart rate, steps, calories burned, sleep quality, and GPS tracking for runs and rides. Advanced features include VO2 max estimation, recovery time recommendations, and personalized coaching insights powered by artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>Beyond the wrist, smart apparel (like shirts, socks, and insoles) can track muscle activity, posture, foot strike, and even body temperature. Smart water bottles ensure optimal hydration, while smart scales track body composition. The goal is to provide holistic data that helps users optimize performance, prevent injuries, improve overall health, and stay motivated through gamified challenges like "closing activity rings."</p>
    <p>The industry continues to innovate, integrating more sophisticated sensors, longer battery life, and seamless connectivity, making these tools indispensable for anyone looking to understand and improve their physical well-being.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "What's got you so engrossed?")</h3>
    <p>The Present Perfect Continuous tense is used to talk about an action that started in the past and is still continuing in the present, or has just stopped but its effects are still visible.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing (present participle)</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Example from dialogue (implied):</strong> Bob is engrossed because he <em>has been checking</em> his stats.</li>
        <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "I've been checking my stats all morning." (The action started in the morning and continues or just finished.)</li>
        <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "The smart insoles have been tracking my foot strike for weeks." (The tracking started weeks ago and is still ongoing.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs (e.g., "saving up," "check out," "turns out")</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning different from the original verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Saving up:</strong> To save money over a period of time for a specific purpose.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>I'm <strong>saving up</strong> for a new bike.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Check out:</strong> To examine something, or to find out more about something.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Check out</strong> this new feature on my fitness tracker!</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Turns out:</strong> To be discovered or revealed, especially unexpectedly.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>It <strong>turns out</strong> my tracker thought stirring coffee was exercise.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Go for:</strong> To choose or opt for something; also to engage in an activity.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>I decided to <strong>go for</strong> a run despite the recommendation.</em></span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Quantifiers and Adverbs of Degree (e.g., "too much," "mostly," "surprisingly")</h3>
    <p>These words modify nouns or verbs to indicate quantity, amount, or intensity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Too much:</strong> Indicates an excessive amount or degree.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>I ate <strong>too much</strong> cake. My feet were <strong>pronating too much</strong>.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Mostly:</strong> Indicates that something is true for the most part, but not entirely.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>I <strong>mostly</strong> trust the tech, but sometimes it's wrong.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Surprisingly:</strong> Indicates that something is unexpected or causes surprise.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>The device is <strong>surprisingly</strong> accurate.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Implicitly:</strong> Without reservation or doubt; totally.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>Do you trust this tech <strong>implicitly</strong>?</em></span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Conditional Sentences (Type 1: Real Possibility)</h3>
    <p>Used to talk about a real and possible situation in the future and its likely result.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> If + Present Simple, ... will + Base Verb / Imperative / Modal verb</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "What if it tells you to run a marathon when you're clearly unwell?" (This is a question form, but follows the same logic.)</li>
        <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home."</li>
        <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "If you charge your smartwatch tonight, it will last all day tomorrow."</li>
    </ul>
