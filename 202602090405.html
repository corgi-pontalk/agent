    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, what's up? You look like you just discovered a new planet.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Not a new planet, just trying to remember all the continents. It's harder than I thought!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Continents? There are only seven, right? Easy peasy.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Easy for you! I keep mixing up Africa and Australia. Both start with 'A'!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, Bob, no! Africa is HUGE, with deserts and safaris. Australia is an island continent, famous for kangaroos!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right, kangaroos. So, Africa: big animals, lots of sand. Australia: bouncy animals, big island.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! And don't forget Asia, it's the biggest. Like, really, really big.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Bigger than Africa? Wow. So, Asia, Africa, Australia... three down. Then there's North America and South America.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bingo! And Europe, where all the fancy old castles are. And Antarctica, the icy bottom of the world.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Antarctica... so cold, even the penguins wear tiny scarves, probably. Is that seven?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Let's count: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica. Yes! Seven!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Phew! Okay, continents mastered. Now, what about oceans? There are... five?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You got it! Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, Arctic.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: The Pacific is the biggest, right? It's like, super-duper enormous.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Correct! So big, it practically touches itself if the Earth were flat.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Good thing it's round then! And the Arctic Ocean is at the top, where Santa lives?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Well, geographically speaking, yes, it's at the North Pole. Close enough to Santa's workshop!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alright, I think my brain just expanded. Thanks, Alice, you're a walking atlas!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Anytime, Bob! Now, let's find some maps and prove you're right about the penguins.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Understanding basic geography is super helpful for everyone, especially if you're learning English! Geography is the study of our Earth, including its land, features, inhabitants, and phenomena. When you know about geography, you can better understand news, travel plans, and even movies!</p>
    <p>For beginners, the most important terms are:</p>

        <li><strong>Oceans</strong>: These are the largest bodies of saltwater on Earth. There are five main oceans: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic.</li>
        <li>Learning about countries, cities, and directions (North, South, East, West) builds on this basic knowledge. It helps you talk about where places are and how to get there.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Simple Tense for Facts and General Truths</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>We use the <strong>Present Simple tense</strong> to talk about things that are always true, facts, or habits. In geography, we often state facts about the world.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Subject + Verb (base form or -s/-es for he/she/it)</li>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Africa <strong>is</strong> HUGE." (A fact about Africa)</li>
                    <li>"Asia <strong>is</strong> the biggest." (A fact about Asia)</li>
                    <li>"The Pacific <strong>is</strong> the biggest." (A fact about the Pacific Ocean)</li>
                    <li>"The Earth <strong>is</strong> round." (A general truth)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Wh- Questions (What, How many)</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p><strong>Wh- questions</strong> are used to ask for specific information. For beginners, "What" and "How many" are very useful.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What</strong>: Used to ask about things, actions, or information.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: "<strong>What's</strong> up?" (What is up?)</li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: "<strong>What</strong> about oceans?" (Asking for information about oceans)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How many</strong>: Used to ask about the quantity of countable nouns.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: "<strong>How many</strong> continents are there?" (Asking for the number of continents)</li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>: "<strong>How many</strong> oceans do we have?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Adjectives for Description</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p><strong>Adjectives</strong> are words that describe nouns (people, places, things). They give us more information about what something is like.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Africa is <strong>HUGE</strong>." (describes Africa)</li>
                    <li>"Australia is an <strong>island</strong> continent." (describes the type of continent)</li>

                    <li><strong>Big</strong> (positive) - <strong>Bigger</strong> (comparative, for 2 things) - <strong>Biggest</strong> (superlative, for 3+ things)</li>
                    <li>Alice uses "biggest" for Asia and the Pacific, showing they are the largest among many.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
