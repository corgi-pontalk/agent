            <h2>Dialogue</h2>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh no, Bob! I completely forgot about the "Fluffy Unicorns" concert tickets! They go on sale *now*!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! You did?! I set an alarm! Let me see... I'm on the website! It's so slow!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Mine too! It just says "Loading..." This is worse than trying to catch a greased pig!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, I see *some* tickets! But they're super expensive, like for VIPs with gold-plated seats!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Gold-plated? Are we booking a rocket ship to the moon or a concert?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! Wait, a new section just popped up! "Balcony View - Limited Availability."</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Quick, Bob, *book them*! Any view is better than no view!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Clicking... clicking... Oh no, it's asking for a captcha. "Select all squares with traffic lights." This is a conspiracy!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A conspiracy to make us miss Fluffy Unicorns! Hurry, I'm refreshing my page. It just went blank!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I think I got through the captcha! Now it's asking for payment details.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Use my card! It's in my purse. Wait, no, use yours, I don't trust the internet with my lucky number right now.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Too late, I'm using mine! Oh, it says "Processing..."</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Did we get them? Please say yes! I've been practicing my air guitar for weeks!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: ...YES! Two tickets for the Fluffy Unicorns! Balcony View! We did it, Alice!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, you're a hero! Let's celebrate with... a practice air guitar concert!</p>

            <h2>Current Situation</h2>
            <p>Booking tickets means buying tickets in advance for an event, a show, or for travel. In modern life, most people book tickets online using websites or special apps on their smartphones. This is fast and convenient.</p>
            <p>You can book tickets for many things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concerts and Shows:</strong> Like a music band performing live or a theatre play.</li>
                <li><strong>Movies:</strong> To watch new films at the cinema.</li>
                <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Such as plane tickets, train tickets, or bus tickets for a trip.</li>
                <li><strong>Sports Events:</strong> To see your favorite team play a game.</li>
                <li><strong>Museums and Attractions:</strong> Especially for popular places, booking ahead can save time and guarantee entry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Often, tickets for popular events sell out very quickly, sometimes within minutes! So, people need to be ready and fast when tickets go on sale. You will typically need to provide your personal information and payment details to complete a booking.</p>

            <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Simple (for facts, habits, and scheduled future events)</strong>
                    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about things that are generally true, happen regularly, or for future events that are part of a schedule.</p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "They <strong>go on sale</strong> *now*!" (A scheduled event happening at a specific time)</em></p>
                    <p><em>Example: "The movie <strong>starts</strong> at 7 PM every evening."</em></p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Present Continuous (for actions happening now)</strong>
                    <p>We use the Present Continuous to describe actions that are happening at the moment we are speaking or for temporary situations.</p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "I<strong>'m on</strong> the website!" (Action happening right now)</em></p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "Now it<strong>'s asking</strong> for payment details." (Action happening at this very moment)</em></p>
                    <p><em>Example: "I <strong>am looking</strong> for my keys right now."</em></p>

                <li><strong>Imperatives (for commands and instructions)</strong>
                    <p>We use imperatives to tell someone directly to do something. They usually start with the base form of the verb and don't need a subject.</p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "Quick, Bob, <strong>book them</strong>!" (A direct instruction)</em></p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "<strong>Use</strong> my card!" (A command)</em></p>
