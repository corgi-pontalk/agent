Alice: Bob! What happened to your arm?! It looks like it wrestled a porcupine!
Bob: Alice! Oh, just a little... gardening incident. Don't worry, the porcupine is fine.
Alice: Gardening? Did a rogue tomato attack you, or did you try to hug a rose bush without gloves?
Bob: Worse. I attempted to prune the giant cactus in my yard. With my bare hands. I thought it would be 'manly'.
Alice: (Biting back laughter) Oh, Bob! You are absolutely unbelievable! What did the doctor say?
Bob: He mostly just shook his head and gave me a very stern lecture about gardening safety. And then he picked out about fifty tiny spines.
Alice: Are you okay, though? Did they give you any special medicine or a giant "Do Not Prune Cacti" sign?
Bob: Just a few bandages and some antiseptic cream. And yes, a strong suggestion to buy proper gardening gloves. No sign, thankfully.
Alice: So, you're at the hospital because you lost a fight with a plant? That's a story for the grandkids.
Bob: Pretty much! And they made me fill out so many forms. My hand was already tired from the cactus, now it's tired from writing.
Alice: That's typical hospital procedure. They love their paperwork more than doctors love coffee.
Bob: And the waiting room music... let's just say it made the cactus spines feel pleasant by comparison.
Alice: Well, at least you're not seriously hurt, Bob. And you learned a valuable lesson, right?
Bob: Absolutely. Never underestimate a cactus. Or the power of a good pair of gloves.
Alice: Next time, call me. I'll lend you my superhero, impenetrable gardening gloves. They even come with a cape.
