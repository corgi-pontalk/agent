    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, what's all this mess? Are you building a mountain of laundry?</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, hi Alice! No, I'm trying to find my keys... and maybe some socks. I think I have five feet of dirty clothes here!</p>
        <p>Alice: Five feet? Bob, you only have two feet! And I see at least three shoes under that pile. Are these all yours?</p>
        <p>Bob: Hmm, maybe some socks are missing their partners. And those shoes... they're like wild animals. I also found two mice in my cupboard last week!</p>
        <p>Alice: Mice? Plural of mouse? You need to clean more often! What else did you find?</p>
        <p>Bob: Well, I found three pens and two pencils under my bed. And look, these are my old toys! I have five toy cars and two action figures.</p>
        <p>Alice: Wow, a treasure hunt! Did you find any books? I lent you three books last month.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, yes! Your books are on the shelf. Near my collection of rocks. I have many rocks from the beach.</p>
        <p>Alice: Rocks are nice. But what about your plates and glasses? I see some dirty plates from last week.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oops. Those are just two plates. And three glasses. I'll wash them. I promise!</p>
        <p>Alice: And what about these? Are these potatoes or small rocks? They look suspiciously similar.</p>
        <p>Bob: Haha, those are potatoes! I was going to make fries. But I also have three tomatoes for a salad.</p>
        <p>Alice: You have so many things! And speaking of things, did you find your keys?</p>
        <p>Bob: My keys! Oh no, I totally forgot! This room has too many objects.</p>
        <p>Alice: Let's find those keys! And maybe some clean clothes for you, too.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>In English, when we talk about more than one item, we usually change the form of the noun. This is called making it "plural." For example, one "cat" becomes two "cats." It's a fundamental part of speaking and writing correctly. While many plurals follow simple rules, some words have special, "irregular" forms that you just need to learn. Understanding plural forms helps you communicate clearly whether you're talking about one thing or many!</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>what's all this mess?</strong>: An informal way to ask about a very untidy or disorganized situation.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I came home and saw toys everywhere. What's all this mess?"</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>missing their partners</strong>: Used for items that usually come in pairs (like socks, shoes) when one is lost or separated.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I only found one glove. It's missing its partner."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>clean more often</strong>: Advice given to someone who doesn't clean regularly enough.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Your desk is covered in papers; you should clean more often."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>a treasure hunt</strong>: A game or activity where you search for hidden items, or metaphorically, an exciting search for something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Finding those old family photos was like a treasure hunt!"</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>I promise!</strong>: Used to give an assurance or a firm commitment to do something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Don't worry, I promise I will finish my homework on time."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>totally forgot</strong>: Completely forgotten about something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Oh no, I totally forgot about my dentist appointment today!"</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points: Plural Forms</h2>
    <p>Most nouns become plural by adding <strong>-s</strong>. However, there are several important rules and exceptions:</p>
    <ul>

            <ul>

                <li>cat &rarr; cat<strong>s</strong></li>
                <li>key &rarr; key<strong>s</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nouns ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, -z: Add -es</strong>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>baby &rarr; bab<strong>ies</strong></li>
                <li>city &rarr; cit<strong>ies</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Note: If the noun ends in a vowel + -y, just add -s (e.g., toy &rarr; toy<strong>s</strong>).</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nouns ending in -o: Add -es</strong> (Common for many, but with exceptions)
            <ul>
                <li>potato &rarr; potato<strong>es</strong></li>
                <li>tomato &rarr; tomato<strong>es</strong></li>
                <li><em>Exception: photo &rarr; photo<strong>s</strong></em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Irregular Plurals: Do not follow regular rules</strong> (You need to memorize these!)
            <ul>
