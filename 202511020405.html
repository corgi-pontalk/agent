        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, Bob, thank goodness! I thought I'd never find anyone!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice? What are you doing here? You look a bit... lost.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I am! Completely! I'm trying to find the new cat cafe, "Purr-fect Coffee." Do you know where it is?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Purr-fect Coffee? Hmm, I think I know it. It's not too far from here.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Really? That's great! My map app is sending me in circles. It says "turn right at the giant banana statue," but there's no banana statue!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> (Laughs) There <em>was</em> a giant banana statue, but they moved it last month. It's now a giant pineapple!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A pineapple? No wonder! So, how do I get to the cat cafe from here?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, so from here, walk straight ahead for about two blocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Straight ahead, two blocks. Got it.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Then, you'll see a big red building on your left. That's a toy store.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A toy store, on my left. Okay.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Turn right after the toy store. The cat cafe will be right there, next to the small park.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> So, straight for two blocks, red toy store on the left, then turn right, and it's next to the park. Got it! Thank you so much, Bob! You're a lifesaver!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> No problem, Alice! Don't get lost again!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I'll try not to! Maybe I'll see you there later for a coffee... and a cat cuddle!</p>

    <div id="current-situation">
        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>In our modern world, we often rely on GPS and map apps to get around. However, sometimes our phones run out of battery, the signal is bad, or the app gives outdated information (like Alice's banana statue problem!). That's why knowing how to ask for and understand directions from people is a very important skill, especially when you are in a new city or country. It helps you find your way, and it's also a great way to interact with local people and practice your English!</p>
    </div>

    <div id="key-phrases">
        <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Excuse me, can you help me?</strong><br>
                <em>(This is a polite way to start a conversation when you need assistance.)</em><br>
                Example: "Excuse me, can you help me? I'm looking for the train station."</li>
            <li><strong>How do I get to [place]?</strong><br>
                <em>(This is a common way to ask for directions to a specific location.)</em><br>
                Example: "How do I get to the museum?"</li>
            <li><strong>Where is [place]?</strong><br>
                <em>(A simpler and direct way to ask for a location.)</em><br>
                Example: "Where is the nearest bank?"</li>
            <li><strong>Go straight ahead. / Walk straight.</strong><br>
                <em>(Means to continue moving forward without turning.)</em><br>
                Example: "Go straight ahead for two blocks."</li>
            <li><strong>Turn left / Turn right.</strong><br>
                <em>(Means to change direction to the left or right.)</em><br>
                Example: "Turn left at the traffic light."</li>
            <li><strong>It's on your left / It's on your right.</strong><br>
                <em>(Used to describe the side where something is located.)</em><br>
                Example: "The store is on your right, next to the cinema."</li>
            <li><strong>It's next to [landmark/place].</strong><br>
                <em>(Used to describe something's location relative to another known place.)</em><br>
                Example: "The cafe is next to the bookstore."</li>
            <li><strong>Thank you so much! / Thanks a lot!</strong><br>
                <em>(Polite ways to express gratitude.)</em><br>
                Example: "Thank you so much for your help!"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Imperative Verbs for Directions</h3>
        <p>We often use verbs in their base form (without 'to' or 'ing') to give commands or instructions. These are called <strong>imperative verbs</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Go</strong> straight.</li>
            <li><strong>Turn</strong> left.</li>
            <li><strong>Walk</strong> for five minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross</strong> the street.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Prepositions of Place</h3>
        <p>Prepositions tell us where something is in relation to something else. They are very important for directions!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ahead:</strong> Go straight <em>ahead</em>. (forward)</li>
            <li><strong>on:</strong> It's <em>on</em> your left. (position on a side)</li>
            <li><strong>next to:</strong> The cafe is <em>next to</em> the park. (beside)</li>
            <li><strong>after:</strong> Turn right <em>after</em> the toy store. (following something)</li>
            <li><strong>for:</strong> Walk straight ahead <em>for</em> two blocks. (duration or distance)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Asking Questions: "How do I get to...?" and "Where is...?"</h3>
        <p>These are the two main ways to ask for directions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How do I get to the museum?</strong> (This asks for the path or route.)</li>
            <li><strong>Where is the bus stop?</strong> (This asks for the exact location.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
