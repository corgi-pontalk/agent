    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, what's that huge box you're carrying? Are you moving house again?<br>
        Bob: Oh, hi Alice! Nope, not moving. This is for my new, incredibly serious hobby!<br>
        Alice: Incredibly serious? What hobby requires a box that big? It looks heavy!<br>
        Bob: It's for competitive marshmallow stacking. High-stakes stuff, you know.<br>
        Alice: Marshmallow stacking? Seriously? Where do you even do something like that?<br>
        Bob: There's a secret society! Just kidding, it's a club. They meet downtown, near the old bookstore.<br>
        Alice: Downtown? When does this… marshmallow club meet? I have to see this.<br>
        Bob: Every Tuesday evening, precisely at 7 PM. Punctuality is key for perfect marshmallow towers.<br>
        Alice: 7 PM? What do you actually *do* there? Just stack sticky sweets?<br>
        Bob: We strategize, we balance, we overcome gravity! The person with the tallest stable stack wins.<br>
        Alice: And what do you win? A lifetime supply of marshmallows?<br>
        Bob: Almost! Bragging rights, a fancy certificate, and sometimes... a giant, novelty marshmallow.<br>
        Alice: Haha! That sounds… unexpectedly fascinating. Where's the next big competition?<br>
        Bob: Next week! At the community center's main hall. It's going to be intense.<br>
        Alice: When exactly? I might actually come and watch this marshmallow madness!<br>
        Bob: Next Tuesday, 7 PM sharp. You really should! It's wilder than you think.<br>
        Alice: Alright, Bob, I'll think about joining your sticky-sweet spectators.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>
        In English, when you want to ask for specific information, you use "Wh- questions." These questions don't usually have a simple "yes" or "no" answer. They help you get details about things, places, or times. Today, we are focusing on three very common ones: <strong>What</strong>, <strong>Where</strong>, and <strong>When</strong>. Mastering these will help you ask for and understand a lot more in everyday conversations!
    </p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What's that?</strong>
            <p>Meaning: Asking about an unknown object or thing.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "What's that sound? Is it raining?"</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>What hobby?</strong>
            <p>Meaning: Asking for details about a specific hobby.</p>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Where do you even do that?</strong>
            <p>Meaning: Asking about the location of an activity, sometimes with a hint of surprise.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "You learned to fly a kite? Where do you even do that in the city?"</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>When does it meet?</strong>
            <p>Meaning: Asking about the scheduled time for an event or group gathering.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "The book club sounds fun! When does it meet?"</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>What do you win?</strong>
            <p>Meaning: Asking about the prize or reward for an activity or competition.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "If I finish this race, what do I win?"</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points: Wh- Questions (What, Where, When)</h2>
    <p>Wh- questions are essential for getting specific information. Let's look at their use and structure:</p>

    <h3>1. What (for things, actions, or information)</h3>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Basic Structure (with other verbs, using 'do/does'):</strong> <em>What + do/does + subject + base verb?</em>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Where are</strong> my keys? (Answer: Your keys are on the table.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Basic Structure (with other verbs, using 'do/does'):</strong> <em>Where + do/does + subject + base verb?</em>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. When (for time)</h3>
    <p>We use "When" to ask about the time, date, or moment of an event.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Structure (with 'be' verb):</strong> <em>When + is/are + subject?</em>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>When is</strong> the meeting? (Answer: The meeting is tomorrow morning.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
