Alice: Bob, guess what? I just remembered my old high school uniform. So many pleats!
Bob: Oh, Alice! Don't even get me started. Mine was a tie that always felt like it was trying to choke me. What a system!
Alice: Right? And the early mornings... my brain felt like it was still asleep until lunch.
Bob: Totally! It's funny how different schools can be, even in the same city. My cousin went to a school that started at 10 AM. Can you believe it?
Alice: Wow, 10 AM? That sounds like a dream! We had to be there by 7:30 AM. It felt like a military academy.
Bob: Haha, I know what you mean. Did you have a lot of homework every night?
Alice: Oh, yes! Especially in math. I used to stare at the textbook for hours, pretending to understand calculus.
Bob: Calculus! You brave soul. I just copied my friend's answers sometimes. Don't tell anyone!
Alice: Bob! You're terrible! But I guess everyone finds ways to survive the school system.
Bob: Exactly! Like, why did we have to learn ancient history if we're never going to be archaeologists?
Alice: Good point! But then again, I did learn to bake a pretty good apple pie in home economics. That was useful!
Bob: See? Some classes *were* practical. What about exams? Did you hate them?
Alice: Absolutely! The pressure! I always felt like my brain was going to explode during a big test.
Bob: Mine too! It's like the whole education system was designed to test how well we could memorize things for one day.
Alice: Maybe! But hey, at least we made it through. Now we can complain about it together!
Bob: True that! High five for surviving!
