    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey, Bob! Long time no see! How's university life treating you?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! It's... an adventure. My roommate just tried to cook pasta in the coffee maker.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Laughs) Oh no! Is that a common thing?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Apparently, when you're hungry and don't own a pot. Or a brain, maybe.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: At least you'll never be bored. What about classes? Are they tough?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Some are. My history professor talks so slowly, I think even the clock falls asleep.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Sounds like a challenge to stay awake! My biggest challenge is finding my classes. The campus map is like a secret treasure hunt.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Tell me about it! I ended up in a chemistry lab instead of a literature lecture last week. They almost gave me a beaker.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Giggles) Did you learn anything useful? Like, how to make coffee that *isn't* made in a coffee maker?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Not really. But I did learn that I should probably get more sleep. I keep confusing my backpack for a pillow.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That's classic! Are you enjoying anything, though? Any fun activities?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, definitely! The university has a really fun board game club. And the pizza place near campus is amazing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Pizza and board games? Sounds like a perfect university survival strategy!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It is. Much better than coffee-maker pasta.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I agree! Well, good luck with the treasure hunt and the sleeping clocks!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You too, Alice! Don't let the beakers get you!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>University life is a big and exciting change for many young people. It's a time when students often move away from home for the first time, live in dorms, and study subjects they are passionate about. It's also a place to meet new friends from all over the world, join interesting clubs, and learn to be independent. Sometimes it can be challenging with tough classes, new responsibilities, or learning to live on your own, but it's also full of new experiences, from late-night study sessions to fun social events and discovering new hobbies.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Simple Tense</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about things that are generally true, happen regularly (habits or routines), or are facts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Subject + Base Verb (add -s for he/she/it)</li>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>"My history professor <strong>talks</strong> so slowly." (A general truth about the professor)</li>
                <li>"The university <strong>has</strong> a really fun board game club." (A fact about the university)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>More Examples</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>"I <strong>study</strong> English every day."</li>
                <li>"She <strong>lives</strong> in a dorm."</li>
                <li>"They <strong>play</strong> football on weekends."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Contractions</h3>
    <p>Contractions are shortened forms of words, common in spoken and informal written English. They combine two words, often using an apostrophe.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>"<strong>It's</strong> an adventure." (It is)</li>
                <li>"<strong>Don't</strong> own a pot." (Do not)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>More Common Contractions</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>I am &rarr; <strong>I'm</strong></li>
                <li>He is / He has &rarr; <strong>He's</strong></li>
                <li>You are &rarr; <strong>You're</strong></li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Asking Questions (Wh- Questions)</h3>
    <p>Words like <strong>What</strong>, <strong>How</strong>, <strong>Where</strong> are used at the beginning of a question to ask for specific information, not just a "yes" or "no" answer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What</strong>: Asks for information about a thing or action.
            <ul>
                <li>Example from dialogue: "<strong>What</strong> about classes?"</li>
