    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, have you seen the news about the 2026 World Cup preparations? It's already getting wild!</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! Wild? I thought it was still ages away. What's the latest drama?</p>
        <p>Alice: Drama is an understatement! They're talking about flying between three different countries for group stages. My poor wallet is already crying.</p>
        <p>Bob: Three countries? That's insane! Are they trying to turn us into professional jet-setters just to watch a match?</p>
        <p>Alice: Exactly! Imagine trying to coordinate travel and accommodation for that. It'll be a logistical nightmare.</p>
        <p>Bob: At least the stadiums are going to be massive. I heard some cities are practically rebuilding entire districts just for the tournament.</p>
        <p>Alice: True, the infrastructure is going to be top-notch. But will the hot dogs still cost an arm and a leg? That's the real question.</p>
        <p>Bob: Priorities, Alice, priorities! I'm more worried about finding a decent pint that isn't watered down stadium brew.</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh, you and your pints! I'm just dreaming of seeing my favorite team play, ideally without having to mortgage my house for a flight.</p>
        <p>Bob: Well, start saving now! Or maybe we just find a really comfy couch and a huge TV. Much less hassle.</p>
        <p>Alice: That's the cynical Bob I know! But think of the atmosphere, the roar of the crowd, the... <em>glamorous</em> cross-continental travel.</p>
        <p>Bob: Okay, okay, you've almost got me with the atmosphere. But seriously, the host cities must be buzzing with activity already.</p>
        <p>Alice: Absolutely! I saw a report about Dallas trying to outdo New York for the final. It's like a sibling rivalry on a grand scale.</p>
        <p>Bob: Dallas vs. New York for the final? That's a match in itself! I hope they have enough taxi drivers.</p>
        <p>Alice: And enough Wi-Fi for all the selfie-taking fans! It's going to be epic, one way or another.</p>
        <p>Bob: Epic and expensive. But hey, it's the World Cup. Worth every penny, right?</p>
        <p>Alice: Almost every penny, Bob. Almost.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <div class="current-situation">
        <p>The FIFA World Cup 2026 marks a historic first, expanding to 48 teams and being co-hosted across three countries: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. With 16 host cities spread across these vast territories, preparations are in full swing, focusing on infrastructure upgrades, stadium renovations, and complex logistical planning. A major talking point is the extensive travel required for teams and fans, with matches scheduled across different time zones and national borders. Organizers are working to streamline security, transportation, and accommodation to ensure a smooth experience for the millions expected to attend. The tournament is anticipated to generate significant economic benefits for the host nations, but also presents unprecedented challenges in coordination and sustainability. Debates continue over the optimal match scheduling to minimize travel fatigue and maximize fan engagement, as the world gears up for a truly continental sporting spectacle.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Present Continuous for Future Arrangements</h3>
        <p>We often use the present continuous (subject + <strong>be</strong> verb + -ing form of the verb) to talk about definite plans or arrangements in the future, especially when details have been discussed or decided.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "They're talking about flying between three different countries for group stages." (This indicates an ongoing discussion or a plan currently being considered/arranged.)</li>
            <li><em>Another example</em>: "Alice and Bob <strong>are meeting</strong> for coffee tomorrow afternoon." (A definite pre-arranged plan.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Speculation and Necessity</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs like <em>will, must, might, could, should</em> are used to express various degrees of certainty, possibility, necessity, or advice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Will</strong>: Used for predictions or future certainty.
                <br><em>Example</em>: "It'll be a logistical nightmare." (Prediction)</li>
            <li><strong>Must</strong>: Used for strong deduction or necessity.
                <br><em>Example</em>: "the host cities <strong>must be</strong> buzzing with activity already." (Strong deduction based on current evidence)</li>
            <li><strong>Should</strong>: Used for advice or expectation.
                <br><em>Example</em>: "You <strong>should start</strong> saving now!" (Advice)</li>
            <li><strong>Might/Could</strong>: Used for possibility.
                <br><em>Example</em>: "We <strong>might need</strong> extra security." (Possibility)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Idiomatic Expressions (Hyperbole)</h3>
        <p>Hyperbole is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech. It's common in informal English to add humor or emphasis to a statement, making it more impactful.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Example 1</em>: "My poor wallet is already crying." (Wallets don't literally cry, but this exaggerates the anticipated financial burden.)</li>
            <li><em>Example 2</em>: "will the hot dogs still <strong>cost an arm and a leg</strong>?" (It won't literally cost body parts, but means it will be extremely expensive.)</li>
            <li><em>Example 3</em>: "having to <strong>mortgage my house</strong> for a flight." (Exaggerating the cost of a flight to emphasize its high price.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding hyperbole is key to grasping the informal and humorous tone often found in everyday English conversations.</p>
