    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Salutations, Bob! I trust this day finds you in excellent spirits?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hey Alice! Whoa, what's with the fancy talk? Just "Hi Bob!" is totally fine, you know.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, pardon my formality! I am attempting to practice my more sophisticated English, as one never knows when one might require such eloquence.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "Sophisticated English," huh? Sounds like you're trying to impress a queen! Most of the time, we just chill out and keep it casual. Like, "What's up?" or "How's it going?"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ah, "What's up?" Very intriguing. So, if I wished to ask if you desired a beverage, would "Would you care for a refreshing elixir?" be appropriate?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> (Laughing) "Elixir"? Alice, are you a wizard? No, just say, "Wanna grab a drink?" or "Fancy a coffee?" Much easier, right?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Wanna grab a drink?" Hmm. It feels... abbreviated. But I shall endeavor! And what about contractions? Are they acceptable?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Totally! We use them all the time. "I am" becomes "I'm," "you are" becomes "you're." It makes speaking so much quicker. Like, "I'm gonna be late if I don't hurry!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Gonna"? Ah, "going to." Fascinating! So, instead of "I will endeavor to ascertain the facts," I could say, "I'll try to find out the facts."</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Exactly! "Find out" is a great example of a phrasal verb. Very common in informal English. Instead of "discover" or "ascertain," we often just "find out."</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> So, when should I employ the formal, and when the informal?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Good question! It depends on the situation. If you're talking to friends or family, informal is best. If you're writing a formal email to a professor or for a job application, then use formal. Think about who you're talking to.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I see. So, for this conversation, I should be... less verbose and more relaxed?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> You got it! Just chill, Alice. No need to sound like you're reading from a historical document.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Understood. Thank you for your guidance, Bob! I appreciate it very much. Catch you later!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> No prob, Alice! See ya!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>In today's English-speaking world, understanding the difference between formal and informal language is crucial. We switch between them constantly, often without even thinking about it!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Informal English</strong> is what we use with friends, family, and people we know well. It's relaxed, often uses contractions (like "I'm," "don't"), slang, and simpler sentences. You'll hear it in everyday conversations, on social media, and in many TV shows and movies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Formal English</strong> is used in more serious or professional situations. This includes business emails, academic papers, official speeches, or when talking to people in positions of authority (like a boss, a doctor, or a teacher you don't know well). It has a more structured grammar, avoids contractions, and uses a more varied and complex vocabulary.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learning to use both is a key step to becoming a fluent English speaker, as it allows you to communicate appropriately in any situation. It's not about one being "better" than the other, but about using the right style for the right context.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-explanation">
        <h3>1. Contractions</h3>
        <p><strong>Informal English</strong> loves contractions! They make speaking faster and sound more natural. We combine two words into one using an apostrophe (').</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I am</strong> → <strong>I'm</strong></li>
            <li><strong>You are</strong> → <strong>You're</strong></li>
            <li><strong>He is</strong> → <strong>He's</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Do not</strong> → <strong>Don't</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cannot</strong> → <strong>Can't</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Will not</strong> → <strong>Won't</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Going to</strong> → <strong>Gonna</strong> (very informal, mostly spoken)</li>
            <li><strong>Want to</strong> → <strong>Wanna</strong> (very informal, mostly spoken)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Formal English</strong> generally avoids contractions. Write out the full words (e.g., "I am," "Do not").</p>

        <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs vs. Single Verbs</h3>
        <p><strong>Informal English</strong> often uses phrasal verbs (a verb + a preposition/adverb) because they are common in everyday speech.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> find out</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> discover, ascertain</li>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> put off</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> postpone</li>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> look into</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> investigate</li>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> get along with</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> be compatible with</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Formal English</strong> prefers single, more sophisticated verbs.</p>

        <h3>3. Vocabulary Choice</h3>
        <p><strong>Informal English</strong> uses simpler, more common words.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> buy</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> purchase</li>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> start</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> commence</li>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> live</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> reside</li>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> ask</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> inquire</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Formal English</strong> uses a wider and often more specific vocabulary, sometimes including words of Latin or Greek origin.</p>

        <h3>4. Directness and Politeness</h3>
        <p><strong>Informal English</strong> can be more direct.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> "Pass me the salt."</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> "Could you please pass the salt?" or "Would you mind passing the salt?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Formal English</strong> uses more polite forms, indirect requests, and softer language (e.g., "Would you mind...", "I would appreciate it if...").</p>
