    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, guess what? I just watched this absolutely wild mental health awareness campaign video!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Wild, Alice? Is that a good 'wild' or a 'what were they thinking' wild? Because honestly, some of those campaigns are... memorable for the wrong reasons.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: No, no, this one was <em>good</em> wild! It had a giant, animated avocado wearing tiny boxing gloves, telling people to "smash the stigma!"</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (chuckles) An avocado with boxing gloves? Okay, that's certainly unique. Did it… make you want to smash anything? Besides your preconceived notions about fruit-based activism?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: It kind of did! It was surprisingly motivational. And then it showed people sharing their feelings with a literal 'comfort blanket' that transformed into a superhero cape.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A superhero cape for feelings? Wow. I usually just get a fuzzy cat and a cup of tea when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Simpler, less prone to spontaneous combustion.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: But don't you think it's brilliant, though? It’s making mental health less scary, more approachable! Instead of those super serious, somber ads that just make you feel even <em>more</em> anxious.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: You've got a point, Alice. Those serious ones can sometimes feel like they're just adding to the pressure, like "Are you mentally healthy <em>enough</em>?"</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! This one was all about acknowledging your feelings, no matter how squishy or green they are, and then taking action. Like, if an avocado can fight stigma, what's <em>my</em> excuse?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (pauses, considering) So, is this the new trend? Cartoon produce encouraging emotional resilience? I'm picturing a grumpy banana telling me to "peel back the layers of my trauma."</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (giggles) Oh, I hope so! Imagine the merchandise! Tiny avocado stress balls, banana mood trackers... the possibilities are endless for destigmatizing the conversation.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: You're right, it does make it feel less like a heavy lecture and more like a friendly chat. Maybe that's what we need to truly break the silence.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: See? I told you it was good wild! And it even had a QR code at the end for free online resources. Super practical.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alright, you've convinced me. If this campaign can get people talking, even if it's about a boxing avocado, then it's doing something right.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Absolutely! Maybe <em>we</em> should start our own campaign. "The Bob and Alice Guide to Emotional Well-being: Featuring surprisingly relatable animal metaphors!"</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (laughs) Only if my mascot is a very chill sloth. And I get to wear a superhero cape.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Deal! Now, let's go find some avocados. For research purposes, obviously.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Obviously.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Mental health awareness campaigns have gained significant traction globally in recent years, moving from niche discussions to mainstream public discourse. Driven by a growing understanding of mental health's impact on overall well-being, these campaigns aim to destigmatize mental illness, encourage open conversations, and promote help-seeking behaviors. Many initiatives leverage social media, celebrity endorsements, and creative storytelling to reach diverse audiences. While progress has been made in breaking down barriers and fostering empathy, challenges remain, including ensuring equitable access to resources, addressing cultural sensitivities, and transitioning from mere awareness to tangible support and effective treatment. The focus is increasingly shifting towards proactive well-being, resilience-building, and creating supportive communities.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Conditional Sentences (Type 1)</h3>
    <p>Type 1 conditional sentences express real or very likely conditions and their results. They are used to talk about general truths, future possibilities, or logical consequences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Structure:</em> If + simple present, will/can/should + base verb.</li>
        <li><em>Examples from dialogue:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>"Like, <strong>if an avocado can fight stigma, what's my excuse?</strong>"</li>
                <li>"<strong>If this campaign can get people talking</strong>, even if it's about a boxing avocado, then it's doing something right."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with a preposition or adverb (or both) to create a new meaning that is often idiomatic and differs from the individual words.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Examples from dialogue:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>"<strong>peel back</strong> the layers of my trauma" (to reveal something gradually)</li>
                <li>"<strong>break the silence</strong>" (to start talking about something previously kept secret)</li>
                <li>"<strong>add to</strong> the pressure" (to increase something)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Modal Verbs for Opinions and Suggestions (Can, Could, Should)</h3>
    <p>These verbs modify the main verb, adding nuance about likelihood, ability, or obligation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Can</strong>: Expresses ability or possibility.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "If an avocado <strong>can</strong> fight stigma..."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Could</strong>: Expresses possibility or suggestion.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "Those serious ones <strong>could</strong> sometimes feel like they're just adding to the pressure..."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Should</strong>: Expresses advice or recommendation.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "Maybe we <strong>should</strong> start our own campaign."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Intensifiers (e.g., "absolutely," "super," "surprisingly")</h3>
    <p>These adverbs strengthen or emphasize the adjective or other adverb they modify, conveying a stronger feeling or degree.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Examples from dialogue:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>"<strong>absolutely</strong> wild"</li>
                <li>"<strong>super</strong> serious"</li>
                <li>"<strong>surprisingly</strong> motivational"</li>
                <li>"<strong>Super</strong> practical"</li>
