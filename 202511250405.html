    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, guess what? I'm planning a trip to Italy!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Wow, Alice! That sounds amazing! Are you all set?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Not really. My paper maps are everywhere, and my brain feels like spaghetti! So many things to book!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Spaghetti brain? Haha! You need travel apps, my friend. They're lifesavers!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Travel apps? Like, for my phone? My phone mostly takes pictures of my cats.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! Think of them as tiny, digital travel agents. For flights, hotels, everything.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hmm. So, no more arguing with hotel brochures? Which app should I download first? There are hundreds!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Start with a flight comparison app. Like 'SkyScanner' or 'Google Flights'. They find the cheapest tickets.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, cheap tickets sound good! My wallet is already crying about gelato. What about a place to sleep?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: For hotels, 'Booking.com' or 'Airbnb' are super popular. You can see pictures and read reviews.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Reviews! Perfect! I need to know if the bed is comfy for my cat naps. And getting around?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: 'Google Maps' is your best friend for navigation. It even tells you about public transport. And for language?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: "Ciao!" is all I know. And "spaghetti." Is there an app for ordering actual spaghetti without hand gestures?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Haha! 'Google Translate' is excellent. You can even point your camera at a menu! And don't forget a currency converter app.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Wow, Bob! My phone might actually be useful for something other than cat videos. Thanks! My trip planning just got a lot less "spaghetti brain"!</p>
