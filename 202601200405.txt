Alice : Hey Bob, did you notice how warm it is today? Bob : Alice! I was just thinking that! It's December, but I'm sweating! Alice : Right? My ice cream melted before I even left the store. This climate change thing is no joke. Bob : Yeah, it’s getting a bit crazy. I tried to walk to work this morning, but then I saw a hot dog stand and just... got a taxi. Alice : Haha! So much for reducing your carbon footprint! Bob : Hey, I carried my own reusable bag for the hot dog! Small steps, Alice, small steps. Alice : True. I actually bought one of those "eco-friendly" water bottles. It's so big, my backpack looks like it's carrying a small whale. Bob : At least you’re trying! I tried to turn off all the lights at home yesterday, but then I couldn't find my socks. It was a dark, sockless adventure. Alice : Oh no! Did you use your phone's flashlight? Bob : Of course! And then my phone battery died. So I just went to bed early. Mission accomplished? Alice : Haha, kind of! At least you saved _some_ energy. Bob : Exactly! What else can we do, besides having early, dark bedtime adventures? Alice : Well, we could try to eat less meat? Or plant a tree. Bob : Planting a tree sounds nice. But do they sell tiny trees for city apartments? Alice : Maybe a cactus? It's green and doesn't need much water! Bob : A climate change cactus! I like it! Let's get one tomorrow. Alice : Sounds like a plan, Bob! Maybe we'll save the world, one cactus at a time. Bob : And one dark, sockless adventure!
