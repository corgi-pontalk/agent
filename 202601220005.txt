Alice : Bob, fancy seeing you here! Are you... clutching a yoga mat? Bob : Alice! Shhh, it's a secret weapon against my desk-job-induced stiffness. Don't tell anyone. Alice : A secret weapon, huh? Last time I checked, your secret weapon was a triple espresso. Bob : Well, times change! I'm trying to embrace the global wellness trend. My back demanded it. Alice : So you've joined the legions of people doing downward dog? I thought you were more of a 'sit on the couch and watch sports' kind of guy. Bob : Hey, I can be both! But seriously, it's pretty relaxing. And the stretches... oh, the stretches! I feel like a pretzel that's finally uncoiling. Alice : (Laughing) A pretzel uncoiling! That's a vivid image. I guess it makes sense, yoga's popularity has really exploded worldwide. Bob : Absolutely! Every second influencer seems to be doing a sunrise warrior pose on a mountain top. It's inspiring... and slightly intimidating. Alice : True! I even saw my grandma trying to do a tree pose last week. She said she was trying to find her "inner zen." Bob : See? It's gone mainstream! From celebrity gurus to local community centers, everyone's seeking a bit of mindfulness. Alice : I tried a hot yoga class once. I felt less zen and more like a melting candle. My "inner zen" was screaming for air conditioning. Bob : (Chuckles) Hot yoga isn't for everyone. But there are so many types now – Vinyasa, Hatha, Restorative... something for every pretzel, I mean, person. Alice : You're really into it, aren't you? Next thing I know, you'll be on a silent meditation retreat in Bali. Bob : Don't tempt me! A digital detox and some serious stretching sound pretty good right now. My shoulders are practically glued to my ears. Alice : Well, good for you, Bob! Maybe I should give it another go. My shoulders could use some un-gluing too. Namaste!
