        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>Alice: Oh, Bob! Is this the right bus stop for the park? I'm so lost!</p>
            <p>Bob: Alice! Hey! Yes, this is it. But which bus are you waiting for?</p>
            <p>Alice: Uh... the one that goes to the park? Number... P2, I think?</p>
            <p>Bob: P2? Are you sure? The park usually takes the Number 7 bus.</p>
            <p>Alice: Oh no! My map said P2! Maybe I read it upside down again.</p>
            <p>Bob: (Laughing) Happens to the best of us! Look, here comes a bus. Is that it?</p>
            <p>Alice: (Squinting) It says... "Sorry, Not in Service." Oh.</p>
            <p>Bob: Nope, that's not it. We need to look for a big number 7 on the front.</p>
            <p>Alice: So, when the bus comes, do I just wave? Or stand really still?</p>
            <p>Bob: You just stand near the stop. When the Number 7 comes, make eye contact with the driver. Not too intense, though!</p>
            <p>Alice: Eye contact... Okay. And then I get on? Do I need a ticket?</p>
            <p>Bob: Yes, you can pay with cash or a card. Do you have exact change for cash?</p>
            <p>Alice: Exact change? I have a giant twenty-dollar bill. Uh oh.</p>
            <p>Bob: (Sighs dramatically) Alice, you're a bus-taking adventure! Don't worry, they usually have card machines.</p>
            <p>Alice: Phew! Okay, look! Is that it? A big red bus, with a 7!</p>
            <p>Bob: Yes! That's it! Quick, let's get ready!</p>
            <p>Alice: Wait, do we get off at the next stop, or the one after? I forgot!</p>
            <p>Bob: (Shaking his head, smiling) We'll figure it out, Alice. Just follow me!</p>
            <p>Alice: Okay, Bob! My bus guru!</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Buses are a very common form of public transportation in many cities and towns. They follow specific routes and stop at designated bus stops to pick up and drop off passengers. People use buses for various reasons, such as commuting to work or school, running errands, or visiting friends. It's often an affordable and eco-friendly way to travel, helping to reduce traffic congestion.</p>
        <p>To take a bus, you usually need to know your route number, wait at the correct stop, and have a way to pay for your fare, such as cash (sometimes needing exact change), a travel card, or a credit/debit card. Many buses also have signs that say "Not in Service" when they are not picking up passengers.</p>

            <h3>1. Prepositions of Place: 'at', 'on', 'for'</h3>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Verb 'To Be' (is, are)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We use '<b>is</b>' for singular subjects (he, she, it, this, that).
                    <p class="example-sentence"><i>Example:</i> <b>Is</b> this the right stop? (This = singular)</p>
                </li>
                <li>We use '<b>are</b>' for plural subjects (we, you, they, these, those).
                    <p class="example-sentence"><i>Example:</i> <b>Are</b> you sure? (You can be singular or plural, but 'are' is used with 'you')</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>3. Simple Present Tense</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><i>Structure:</i> Subject + Base Verb (add '-s' or '-es' for he/she/it)</li>
                <li><i>Examples from dialogue:</i> "It <b>says</b> 'Sorry, Not in Service'." (It = singular, so 'says') "It <b>happens</b> to the best of us."</li>
