    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, you look a bit tired today! Long day?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! Yeah, it's not the day, it's my tiny apartment. I tripped over my own shoes this morning because there's just no space!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh no! Is it really that small?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It's like a shoebox! One bedroom, a tiny living room, and a kitchen that doubles as a hallway.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Wow! My house is bigger, but sometimes I can't find anything. It has three bedrooms.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Three bedrooms? I could get lost in there! I only have <em>one</em> room, practically.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: We also have a big garden. My dog, Sparky, loves to play there.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A garden? I have a window box with a dying plant. That's my "garden".</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Is there anything you like about your place?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hmm, the coffee shop downstairs is great. Does that count as part of my house?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha, nice try! Well, my favorite room is the kitchen. It's really sunny.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Sunny kitchen! Mine is so dark, I need a flashlight to find the cereal.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You should come over sometime! We can cook in my sunny kitchen.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Really? Yes, please! I'll bring my own flashlight, just in case.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: No need! And Sparky would love to meet you.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perfect! Maybe I'll learn how to find my cereal without tripping.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Talking about your house or apartment is a very common and natural part of daily conversation. Whether you're making small talk with new acquaintances or catching up with friends, describing where you live is a great way to share personal information and learn about others. It also helps you practice essential vocabulary related to rooms, furniture, and adjectives to describe spaces. For beginners, it's an excellent topic to use simple sentence structures and basic verbs like "to be" and "to have."</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. The Verb "To Be" (is, am, are)</h3>
