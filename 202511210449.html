    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, did you see the news about oil prices for 2025? My grand road trip dreams are officially in jeopardy!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, tell me about it! I was just fantasizing about driving my old beat-up car across the country, but at this rate, I'll need a second mortgage just for gas money.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! They're predicting another wild ride. Some experts say prices will skyrocket due to supply cuts, others claim they'll stabilize if demand slows down.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: "Stabilize" is a fancy word for "still too expensive for my budget." My car drinks petrol like it's going out of style. I'll be pinching pennies just to get to the grocery store.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Maybe we should invest in roller skates? Or a very enthusiastic tandem bike? Imagine, "The Great American Pedal Adventure!"</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Hah! My knees would be in jeopardy long before my wallet. But seriously, if prices keep surging, nobody will be going anywhere far. It'll put a real damper on summer vacation plans.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: It’s all about geopolitics and global demand, apparently. If there's any unrest, boom, prices go up. If a new oil field is discovered, maybe they dip a little.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: So, we're basically at the mercy of factors we can't control? Fantastic. I guess my fantasy RV is out of the question then.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Don't give up hope entirely! Maybe by mid-2025, things will settle down. Or maybe electric cars will suddenly become dirt cheap and everyone will switch overnight.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: One can dream, Alice. One can dream. For now, I'm just bracing myself for the shock at the pump. I might start collecting coupons for gas.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Gas coupons? That's a relic from another era! You're really desperate. I'm just going to plan local trips, maybe explore our own city more.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Local trips it is, then. We could always carpool if we decide to venture further. Misery loves company, and shared gas expenses are definitely less miserable.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Good idea! We can take turns driving our slightly-less-thirsty cars. Though mine still feels like it's chugging premium champagne.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Mine feels like it’s chugging crude oil straight from the well! But hey, at least we have each other for moral support when the gas station bill arrives.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: True! We'll just have to be savvy travelers. Who needs a cross-country trip when you have a friend and a slightly-less-empty wallet?</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Oil prices are inherently volatile, influenced by a complex interplay of global supply, demand, and geopolitical events. For 2025, predictions are, naturally, speculative. Factors such as ongoing geopolitical tensions, potential economic growth (or slowdowns) in major consuming nations like China and India, the pace of the global energy transition, and OPEC+'s production policies will significantly shape the market. While some forecasts suggest continued upward pressure due to tight supply and resilient demand, others anticipate a leveling off or even a decrease if global economic activity slows or new production sources come online. Consumers should generally brace themselves for continued fluctuations, making budgeting for transportation costs an ongoing challenge.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Future Simple (will/won't) for Predictions and Intentions</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>We use <strong>will</strong> or <strong>won't (will not)</strong> to talk about future actions or events that we expect or predict, or to express intentions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> Something you believe will happen.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>They're predicting another wild ride. Some experts say prices <strong>will skyrocket</strong>.</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>If prices keep surging, nobody <strong>will be going</strong> anywhere far.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Intention/Decision made at the moment of speaking:</strong> Something you decide to do.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>I <strong>will</strong> definitely start saving more money for gas.</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>I'm just going to plan local trips, maybe explore our own city more. (Alice's intention)</em></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>2. First Conditional (If + Present Simple, will + Verb)</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>The first conditional is used to talk about possible future events and their likely results. It describes real and possible situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> If + subject + verb (present simple), subject + will + base form of verb.</li>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em><strong>If</strong> prices <strong>keep surging</strong>, nobody <strong>will be going</strong> anywhere far.</em> (A real possibility)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em><strong>If</strong> there's any unrest, boom, prices <strong>go up</strong>. (Implied 'will go up')</em></p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em><strong>If</strong> a new oil field <strong>is discovered</strong>, maybe they <strong>dip</strong> a little. (Implied 'will dip')</em></p>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Modal Verbs for Speculation (might/could)</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>We use modal verbs like <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> to express possibility or uncertainty about future events.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Might/Could:</strong> Used when something is possible but not certain.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Maybe by mid-2025, things <strong>will settle down</strong>. Or maybe electric cars <strong>will suddenly become</strong> dirt cheap.</em> (Alice uses 'will' here to express a hope, but implicitly, it's a possibility.)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>They <strong>might stabilize</strong> if demand slows down.</em> (More explicit possibility)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>It <strong>could go</strong> either way, depending on global politics.</em></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
