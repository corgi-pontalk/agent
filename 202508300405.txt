Alice : Hey Bob, what are you looking at? Bob : Oh, hi Alice! Just admiring this... uh... *very* bright thing. Alice : That's a yellow flower, Bob. Yellow , like the sun! Bob : Yellow? Are you sure? I thought 'sun-colored' was a color. Alice : It is now! And your shirt is blue , Bob. Like the sky! Bob : Blue , got it! So, the sky is blue , the sun is yellow. What about that car? Alice : That car is red , Bob. Like a tomato! Bob : Ah, red! So, if tomatoes are red , what color is an apple? Alice : Apples can be red , green , or yellow! This one is red. Bob : Wow, so many! My backpack is... 'dirt-colored'? Alice : Your backpack is brown , Bob. Like delicious chocolate! Bob : Mmm, chocolate brown! I like that. And this leaf? Alice : That leaf is green. Most leaves are green. Bob : Green , okay. So, my favorite color is... the color of a clear sky! Alice : That's blue , Bob! You're really getting good at this!
