    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess how many popcorn kernels I just counted in this bag!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you counted them? Seriously? My guess is... oh, let's say, seventy-three?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Seventy-three? Way off! It's exactly ninety-nine!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ninety-nine? Wow, that's almost a hundred. Are you sure you didn't miss one?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Positive! I even double-checked. My eyesight is twenty-twenty, remember?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right, right. So, if we have ninety-nine kernels, and there are two of us... that's forty-nine and a half each. Unfair!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Don't be dramatic. I was just illustrating a point. We're having a movie night, and I need you to grab some snacks. How many bags of chips do we need for five people?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Five people... so, uh, five bags? One each?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Are you new to snack allocation? We need at least two bags per person, so that's ten bags total. Plus, maybe three extra for emergencies.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ten plus three... thirteen bags of chips. My car can barely fit thirteen bags of anything!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Okay, maybe twelve then. And two large sodas. Oh, and how many boxes of those mini chocolates did you say you wanted? Like, fifty?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Fifty mini chocolates? I said five! F-I-V-E! You're trying to bankrupt me, Alice!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oops, my bad! My ears must be twenty-twenty, but my memory is fifty-fifty sometimes. Just get five boxes, then.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And don't forget the twelve bags of chips. This is going to cost at least forty-seven dollars.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Alright, bargain hunter. See you in twenty minutes!
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Numbers from 1 to 100 are foundational for everyday communication in English. They are used constantly for a wide range of purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Counting:</strong> "There are five apples."</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> "She is twenty-three years old."</li>
        <li><strong>Money:</strong> "That costs fifty dollars."</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> "Meet me at seven o'clock." (Often combined with other time expressions)</li>
        <li><strong>Quantities:</strong> "We need a hundred pages."</li>
        <li><strong>Addresses and Phone Numbers:</strong> "My address is seventy-four Oak Street." (Though phone numbers are often read digit by digit).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mastering these numbers not only helps in practical situations but also builds confidence in understanding and speaking English in various contexts, from shopping to travel to social interactions. While the basic numbers (one to ten) are simple, numbers from eleven to nineteen and the "tens" (twenty, thirty, etc.) have specific patterns that are crucial to learn.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Way off</span>: Far from the correct answer or estimate.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "Your guess of ten thousand was <strong>way off</strong>; the actual number was only one hundred."</span></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Twenty-twenty eyesight</span>: Perfect vision.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "The pilot had <strong>twenty-twenty eyesight</strong>, so he could see the runway clearly."</span></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Don't be dramatic</span>: Don't exaggerate or overreact.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "It's just a small scratch, <strong>don't be dramatic</strong>!"</span></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Snack allocation</span>: The process of distributing or assigning snacks.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "The teacher was in charge of <strong>snack allocation</strong> for the field trip."</span></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Bankrupt me</span>: To make someone lose all their money; to cause financial ruin. Often used humorously for something expensive.

            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "Oh, I forgot to send that email. <strong>My bad</strong>!"</span></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Fifty-fifty</span>: Having an equal chance; an even split. In the dialogue, used humorously to describe inconsistent memory.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "It's a <strong>fifty-fifty</strong> chance whether it will rain today."</span></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Bargain hunter</span>: Someone who actively looks for products at reduced prices or good deals.

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3><span class="grammar-point">1. Cardinal Numbers (1-100)</span></h3>
    <p>Cardinal numbers are used for counting and indicating quantity. Here's how they are generally formed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Numbers 1-10:</strong> Each has a unique word (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten).</li>
        <li><strong>Numbers 11-19 (the "teens"):</strong> These also have unique words, often ending in "-teen" (eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen). Note the irregular spellings of eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fifteen.</li>
        <li><strong>Numbers 20-90 (the "tens"):</strong> These are formed by adding "-ty" to the base number (twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety). Note the spelling changes for forty and fifty.</li>
        <li><strong>Numbers 21-99:</strong> These are formed by combining the "tens" number with a single digit number, separated by a hyphen.
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <strong>twenty-one</strong>, <strong>thirty-five</strong>, <strong>seventy-eight</strong>, <strong>ninety-nine</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Number 100:</strong> Expressed as <strong>one hundred</strong> or <strong>a hundred</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Remember the unique words for 1-19, the "-ty" endings for multiples of ten, and the hyphen for numbers between 21 and 99.</p>

    <h3><span class="grammar-point">2. Using Numbers in Context</span></h3>
    <p>Numbers often accompany nouns to indicate quantity. You'll typically use the plural form of the noun with numbers greater than one.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: "five <strong>people</strong>", "two <strong>sodas</strong>", "twelve <strong>bags</strong> of chips", "forty-seven <strong>dollars</strong>".</li>
        <li>When referring to a single item, use the singular noun: "one <strong>bag</strong>", "one <strong>dollar</strong>".</li>
    </ul>
