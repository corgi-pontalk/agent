Alice: Ugh, Bob, this line is so long! Are we ever going to get to the counter?
Bob: Relax, Alice! We're almost there. What are you sending that's so urgent?
Alice: It's a huge box for my grandma's birthday. It's full of handmade socks and her favorite tea. Don't laugh!
Bob: Wow, that box looks heavy! Are you sure it's not full of rocks? Just kidding, just kidding!
Alice: Very funny! So, do I need special stamps, or should I send it as 'registered mail' to make sure it arrives safely?
Bob: 'Registered mail' is a good idea for something important. You'll need to fill out a form for that. Do you have a pen?
Alice: A pen? Oh no! I totally forgot my pen! I always do that. Do you, by any chance, have an extra one?
Bob: My lucky day! I always carry my trusty pen. Here you go, Super Sender!
Alice: Haha, thanks, Bob! And, uh, where do I buy the packing tape? This box is trying to open itself.
Bob: They usually have it at the counter, or sometimes there's a small self- service station near the entrance.
Alice: Phew, this is more complicated than sending a text message. I might need a coffee after this.
Bob: Don't worry, you're doing great! And your grandma will love those socks. What's the address again?
Alice: Oh, I have it written on a small paper... somewhere. Wait, here it is!
Bob: Good! Make sure you write it clearly on the form. And remember to put the return address too!
Alice: Okay, okay, wish me luck with this paperwork monster!
