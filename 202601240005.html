    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, have you seen that new campaign for ocean cleanup? Leonardo DiCaprio just posted about it with a picture of himself looking very thoughtful next to a single plastic bottle.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Oh, Alice! I saw that! I swear, Leo could make watching paint dry look like a profound philosophical journey. He's practically the <b>patron saint of</b> saving things.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Right? And now everyone's debating if he genuinely cares or if it's just good PR. It's like, can't a multi-millionaire just want cleaner oceans without an entire internet inquisition?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Exactly! Though I do wonder sometimes if they actually know what they're talking about, or if they just have really good speechwriters. Remember that one pop star who tried to explain quantum physics for world peace? That was... ambitious.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Oh, don't even <b>get me started</b>! It's always 'save the pandas' or 'end world hunger,' which, yes, are <b>noble causes</b>. But I'm waiting for a celebrity to <b>champion something niche</b>, like advocating for the return of the floppy disk.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Now *that* would <b>get my attention</b>! Imagine Angelina Jolie passionately arguing for better floppy disk storage. I'd sign up for that mailing list instantly.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Or maybe someone campaigning for the proper way to load a dishwasher. My roommate clearly needs a <b>celebrity intervention</b> on that front.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: See, those are issues that *really* affect daily life! It's easy to donate to a big cause, but it takes true dedication to show people how to arrange cutlery for optimal cleaning.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Maybe we should start our own micro-celebrity activism movement. I'll be the face of 'No Socks with Sandals.'</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: And I'll be the voice of 'One-Ply Toilet Paper is an Abomination.' We'd be internet sensations overnight!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: We'd probably just get shouted at by people who love their sandal-sock combo.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: True. It's a tough gig, even for actual celebrities. They <b>put their neck out there</b>, and half the internet calls them <b>virtue-signaling hypocrites</b> while the other half <b>hails them as saviors</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: It's a <b>lose-lose</b> sometimes. But at least it gets people talking, right? Even if it's about Leo's perfectly windswept hair next to a single plastic bottle.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Absolutely. Awareness is the first step, even if it comes with a side of <b>eye-rolling</b>. So, ready to draft our 'No Socks with Sandals' manifesto?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Only if we get a professional photographer to capture our serious, thoughtful expressions. Maybe next to a discarded sock.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>
        Celebrity activism, where public figures use their platform and influence to advocate for social, political, or environmental causes, has become an increasingly prominent feature of modern culture. With the rise of social media, celebrities can instantly reach millions of followers, transforming their personal opinions into global discussions. This can lead to significant positive outcomes, such as raising massive awareness for often overlooked issues, generating substantial donations for charities, and mobilizing public opinion. Many successful campaigns owe their visibility to famous endorsements.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, celebrity activism is also a hotly debated topic. Critics often accuse celebrities of "virtue signaling" – promoting a cause to enhance their own image rather than out of genuine conviction. Questions are frequently raised about their actual understanding of complex issues, leading to accusations of superficial engagement or even hypocrisy, especially when their lavish lifestyles seem to contradict the values they champion. Furthermore, the sheer weight of a celebrity's influence can sometimes overshadow the voices of grassroots activists or experts. Despite these criticisms, the power of a celebrity endorsement to <b>cut through noise</b> and capture public attention remains undeniable, making them a <b>double-edged sword</b> in the world of social change.

            <b>Answers to Exercise 4:</b>
            <p><i>(Example Answer)</i> I think celebrity activism is a <span class="highlight">double-edged sword</span>. On one hand, it definitely helps to <span class="highlight">cut through the noise</span> and bring attention to <span class="highlight">noble causes</span>. If a famous person posts about an issue, millions see it. However, sometimes I feel like it's just virtue-signaling, and I wonder if they truly understand the complexities of the issue. If I <span class="highlight">were</span> a celebrity, I <span class="highlight">would</span> probably focus on one specific cause that I'm genuinely passionate about, rather than trying to support everything.</p>
