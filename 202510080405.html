    <p>Welcome to your English learning journey! Today, we'll learn about sending emails through a fun dialogue and practical exercises.</p>

    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p>Alice and Bob are friends. Bob is trying to send an important email.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, what's wrong? You look like you're fighting a computer!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Oh, thank goodness. I am! I need to send this really important email, but it's not working right.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> What's the problem? Did you forget the 'send' button?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> No, no, I clicked it! But then I realized... I forgot the attachment!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, the classic move! What's the attachment?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It's my super secret recipe for banana bread. It's for my boss.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Your boss? For banana bread? Is that work-related?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, it's a 'team-building' exercise. She asked everyone to bring their favorite recipe.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Okay, that's fun! Did you write a subject line?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yes! 'My Banana Bread Will Conquer All!'</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob! That's... enthusiastic. Maybe change it to 'Banana Bread Recipe - Bob'?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hmm, good point. More professional. And I need to attach the file again, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly. Click the little paperclip icon, find your file, and then hit send again.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Got it! And next time, I'll check for attachments <em>before</em> sending.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Smart move! Good luck with the banana bread conquest!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Simple Present Tense</h3>
    <p>We use the simple present tense for actions that happen regularly, facts, or things that are generally true.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Affirmative:</strong> Subject + Verb (add -s for he/she/it)
            <p><em>Examples:</em> I <strong>send</strong> emails. He <strong>sends</strong> emails. It <strong>works</strong>.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Subject + do/does not + Verb (base form)
            <p><em>Examples:</em> I <strong>do not send</strong> emails often. It <strong>does not work</strong> right.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Questions:</strong> Do/Does + Subject + Verb (base form)?
            <p><em>Examples:</em> <strong>Do</strong> you <strong>send</strong> emails? <strong>Does</strong> it <strong>work</strong>?</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Imperative Verbs</h3>
    <p>We use imperative verbs to give commands, instructions, or advice. There is no subject (the subject 'you' is understood), you just start with the verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive:</strong> Verb (base form) + (Object/Rest of sentence)
            <p><em>Examples:</em> <strong>Click</strong> the button. <strong>Attach</strong> the file. <strong>Send</strong> the email.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Don't + Verb (base form) + (Object/Rest of sentence)
            <p><em>Examples:</em> <strong>Don't forget</strong> the attachment. <strong>Don't send</strong> it yet.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. "Did you...?" Questions (Simple Past)</h3>
    <p>We use "Did you...?" to ask about actions that happened in the past and are now finished. We use the base form of the verb after 'did'.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Question:</strong> Did + Subject + Base Form of Verb?
            <p><em>Examples:</em> <strong>Did you forget</strong> your keys? <strong>Did you write</strong> the email?</p></li>
        <li><strong>Short Answers:</strong> Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.
            <p><em>Examples:</em> Did you click send? "Yes, I did." Did you attach the file? "No, I didn't."</p></li>
    </ul>
