    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, guess what exciting thing I've been planning for my next vacation?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, your eyes are practically sparkling. Did you finally book that space tourism trip, or have you discovered a new artisanal cheese shop?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Even better! I'm diving headfirst into <span class="key-phrase">eco-tourism</span>! No spaceships, just good old Mother Earth.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Eco-what now? Does that mean I have to hike everywhere barefoot and only eat sustainably sourced twigs?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, not quite! It's about responsible travel that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of <span class="key-phrase">local communities</span>. So, less giant resort, more local guesthouse.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm. So, no more flying halfway across the world, contributing to my monstrous <span class="key-phrase">carbon footprint</span>, just to lie on a beach?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! Or, if you do fly, you might choose an airline that offsets its emissions, or simply try to travel less often. It's about making conscious choices.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: So, if I go "glamping" in a fancy tent with a butler, is that still eco-tourism? Because I'm not sure I can give up my creature comforts.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Well, it depends! Is that glamping site powered by solar, hiring local staff, and sourcing food from nearby farms? If so, then possibly! It’s about being <span class="key-phrase">sustainable travel</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Alright, you've piqued my interest. So, what's your grand eco-adventure plan? Going to volunteer with turtles in Costa Rica?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: That's one idea! Or perhaps an <span class="key-phrase">immersive experience</span> with a local tribe, learning their crafts. The possibilities are endless, as long as they help <span class="key-phrase">give back to</span> the place you visit.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Sounds... virtuous. But how do you know if a place is genuinely eco-friendly and not just doing some clever <span class="key-phrase">greenwashing</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: That's the tricky part! You have to do your research. Look for certifications, read reviews, and check if their claims are backed by actions, not just pretty pictures.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: So, no more plastic souvenirs shaped like Big Ben, then? Just artisan-made, locally sourced, biodegradable Big Ben replicas?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Precisely! And maybe you can even help make it yourself. Now, are you in for my next eco-adventure, or are you sticking to your backyard "staycation" again?</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Eco-tourism, a rapidly growing sector within the travel industry, focuses on responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of local people, and involves interpretation and education. It's more than just "green travel"; it emphasizes minimal impact, building environmental and cultural awareness and respect, providing positive experiences for both visitors and hosts, direct financial benefits for conservation, and financial benefits and empowerment for local people.</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a significant shift in traveler mindset towards sustainability. A heightened awareness of climate change and social responsibility, coupled with a desire for authentic, immersive experiences, has fueled the rise of eco-tourism. Travelers are increasingly seeking destinations and activities that align with their values, prioritizing local engagement, conservation efforts, and reduced carbon footprints. However, the industry also faces challenges such as "greenwashing," where businesses make misleading claims about their environmental practices, and the need for robust certification and regulatory standards to ensure genuine sustainability.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. <span class="grammar-point">Present Perfect for Recent Events/Experiences</span></h3>
    <p>The present perfect tense is used to describe actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past or actions that started in the past and continue to the present. It often connects past events to the present situation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Form</span>: have/has + past participle (V3)</li>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Usage in context</span>:
            <ol>
                <li>To talk about experiences that happened at some point in your life (often using "ever," "never").
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I <span class="grammar-point">have visited</span> three different eco-resorts." (The experience is relevant now)</p></li>
                <li>To describe actions that started in the past and continue up to the present (often with "for" or "since").
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I <span class="grammar-point">have been looking into</span> eco-tourism for months." (Started in the past, still relevant now)</p></li>
                <li>To describe a recent action with a result that affects the present.
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Alice's eyes are practically sparkling. She <span class="grammar-point">has just booked</span> an eco-adventure." (The booking is recent, and its effect - sparkling eyes - is present).</p></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. <span class="grammar-point">Phrasal Verbs (Related to Travel and Environment)</span></h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs combine a verb with a preposition or an adverb (or both), creating a new meaning that is often different from the original verb. They are very common in spoken and informal English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Diving headfirst into (something)</span>: To start doing something with a lot of enthusiasm and commitment.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I'm <span class="grammar-point">diving headfirst into</span> learning Spanish before my trip to Mexico."</p></li>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Cut down on (something)</span>: To reduce the amount of something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Many people want to <span class="grammar-point">cut down on</span> their plastic waste."</p></li>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Look into (something)</span>: To investigate or research something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I need to <span class="grammar-point">look into</span> the best sustainable transportation options for my vacation."</p></li>
