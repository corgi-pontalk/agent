    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob! That meeting was a disaster! My brain feels like scrambled eggs.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, Alice, tell me about it. My head is still spinning. Did we even achieve anything?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Seriously! "Let's touch base offline"? What does that even mean? Are we playing tag?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Haha, not quite. It means talk later, outside the meeting. People love to sound fancy.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: And "circle back on this next week"? Did we forget something important in a circle?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: That's just a polite way to say "we'll discuss it again later." They usually want to avoid making a decision *now*.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It felt like everyone was speaking a secret code! I just nodded and smiled a lot, hoping nobody would ask me anything.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I know the feeling. Sometimes I pretend to take notes, but I'm really just doodling funny monsters.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, any tips for our *next* meeting? I don't want to get lost in translation again. I hate feeling clueless.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Definitely. Try to learn some common meeting phrases. Like "I agree" or "I have a question." Simple stuff first.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good idea. And what if I don't understand something? Can I just ask?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Absolutely! You can say, "Could you please explain that?" or "Could you repeat that, please?" It’s better to ask than to guess wrong.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That sounds less scary. I thought I had to understand everything perfectly or look silly.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Nobody does, Alice. English meetings often use very specific business jargon. Even native speakers get confused sometimes!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Okay, Bob. Next meeting, I'm bringing my dictionary... and maybe a phrasebook! Wish me luck!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Good luck! Let's touch base after it to see how it went. Don't forget your monster drawings!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>In today's globalized world, English is often the common language in international business meetings, even if participants are not native English speakers. This means you might find yourself in a meeting where English is spoken, regardless of your country or company.</p>
    <p>For beginners, meetings in English can be challenging. People might speak quickly, use unfamiliar business jargon (special words used in business), or have different accents. It's easy to feel lost or afraid to speak up. However, it's a great opportunity to practice your listening and speaking skills. Many people in English meetings are also learning, so don't be afraid to ask for clarification!</p>
