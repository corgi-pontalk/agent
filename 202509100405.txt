Alice : Oh, hi Bob! Just thinking about food. My stomach is rumbling! Bob : Alice, I'm so glad you said that! My stomach sounds like a grumpy bear. What's for lunch? Alice : Hmm, how about a sandwich? Or maybe a salad? Bob : A salad? Alice, I'm too hungry for leaves! Do we have any pizza? I _love_ pizza! Alice : Haha, I figured! Yes, I think there's some leftover pizza. How many slices do you want? Bob : Two! No, wait, three! Make it four! My bear is very hungry. Alice : Four slices? Bob, are you sure? You'll turn into a pizza! Bob : (Mouth full) Maybe I _want_ to be a pizza! What about drinks? Do we have juice? Alice : We have orange juice and water. Or milk if you prefer. Bob : Orange juice sounds great! And a big glass, please. Alice : Okay, one very large orange juice coming up. Are you going to eat all four slices by yourself? Bob : Of course! And maybe a cookie for dessert. Do we have cookies? Alice : We do! But maybe just one. Don't want you to explode before dinner! Bob : Sounds like a plan! This is the best lunch ever, Alice. Thank you! Alice : You're welcome, Bob! Enjoy your pizza mountain.
