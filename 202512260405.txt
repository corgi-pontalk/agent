Bob : Alice! You look stressed. Everything okay? Alice : Oh, Bob! Just another Tuesday, drowning in emails. Bob : Emails? Already? It's barely 9 AM! Alice : Tell me about it! My inbox is a black hole. Things go in, but they never truly come out. Bob : Haha, I know the feeling. Did you see Sarah's email about the "urgent" cake order? Alice : The one with the subject line 'URGENT: Sugar Emergency'? Bob : That's the one! I almost replied with 'URGENT: Send Coffee'. Alice : I saw! And then Mark 'replied all' asking if it was gluten-free. Seriously? Bob : Of course he did! It's like email etiquette goes out the window when cake is involved. Alice : Exactly! And don't even get me started on the passive-aggressive emails. "Just a friendly reminder..." when it really means "You forgot!" Bob : Oh, those! Or the ones that are a single sentence. "See attached." That's it! Alice : Or the really long ones that make you scroll for ages. I need a TL;DR button for work emails. Bob : What's TL;DR? Alice : Too Long; Didn't Read! It's an internet thing. Very useful for overly detailed reports. Bob : Haha, I should start using that. My boss might get confused though. Alice : Probably! But seriously, how do you handle your inbox? Bob : I try to keep subject lines clear and reply promptly. And I never, ever 'reply all' unless absolutely necessary. Alice : Good advice, Bob. Maybe I should implement a 'no cake-related email' policy for myself. Bob : Good luck with that, Alice! See you later!
