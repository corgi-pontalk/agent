Alice: Bob, did you hear about the latest news? It's utterly wild!
Bob: Alice, you mean the one about the... *Alaska* summit? I thought it was a joke at first!
Alice: Exactly! Trump and Putin, in the land of ice and polar bears. I can already picture it.
Bob: Right? I'm imagining Trump trying to 'Make Alaska Great Again' by installing heated sidewalks in Anchorage.
Alice: And Putin arriving on a polar bear, probably shirtless, carrying a fishing spear. For the photo op, naturally.
Bob: Only if he's wearing a tiny, embroidered "MAGA" hat on the bear. Or maybe just a very stylish fur-lined parka.
Alice: Are they discussing global warming, or just who can build the tallest igloo without frostbite?
Bob: My money's on a competition to see who can catch the biggest salmon with their bare hands. Winner gets bragging rights and a frozen fish trophy.
Alice: Followed by a hot dog eating contest, but with caribou sausages. Served by Secret Service agents in snowsuits, of course.
Bob: And then a 'friendly' arm wrestle on a frozen lake, surrounded by ice- sculpture replicas of their faces.
Alice: I hope they brought extra-thick gloves. Imagine trying to negotiate a peace treaty with numb, frostbitten fingers!
Bob: Maybe they'll just bond over their shared love for dramatic, slightly absurd photo opportunities.
Alice: Or discover a mutual appreciation for really strong coffee in sub-zero temperatures. Anything to stay warm!
Bob: One thing's for sure, it won't be boring. And it will definitely be very, very cold.
Alice: I'd pay good money to watch the blooper reel from that summit.
