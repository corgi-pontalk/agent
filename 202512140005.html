    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, you will not BELIEVE what I just read!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice, given your usual news sources, is it about a squirrel piloting a miniature jet or a new flavor of artisanal cheese?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ha, very funny! No, it's about college sports. Apparently, a star freshman quarterback just signed an NIL deal for over a million dollars!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A million dollars?! For a *college* kid? Man, I picked the wrong era to attend university. My 'name, image, and likeness' deal got me... free extra ketchup packets at the cafeteria.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Tell me about it! It's wild how much college sports have **blown up**. It feels less like **amateur athletics** and more like a **minor league** for the pros these days.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Minor league? Some of these college stadiums are **bigger** than actual NFL venues! And the **fan engagement**? It's intense. My cousin almost got into a brawl over a disputed call at a college basketball game last week.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> See? It's not just the money for the athletes. The **revenue** from TV rights, sponsorships, merchandise – it's **astronomical**. Universities are building palaces for their sports programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Absolutely. I saw a report that the **biggest** college football programs generate hundreds of millions annually. It's no longer just a side hobby; it's a massive entertainment industry.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Which makes you wonder, are they still 'student-athletes' or more like 'athlete-students'? The pressure to perform must be immense, balancing academics with essentially a full-time professional career.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Good point. I mean, if I **had** a million-dollar contract on the line, my calculus homework **might take a backseat** to practice drills. Education is still supposedly the core, but the lines are getting really **blurry**.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Totally. It's fascinating to watch, though. The quality of play is incredible, and the rivalries are legendary. It brings communities together.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Definitely. And it's creating new opportunities, too. Not just for the athletes, but for coaches, medical staff, marketers, even content creators for their personal brands.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> So, we agree it's massive, complicated, and probably still growing?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Absolutely. I'm just hoping my future kids are exceptionally athletic so I can retire off their NIL deals. No pressure, little ones!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (Laughing) Dream big, Bob. Dream big.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The landscape of college sports in the U.S. has undergone a dramatic transformation, evolving from purely **amateur athletics** into a multi-billion dollar industry. This growth is primarily fueled by massive broadcasting contracts, increased corporate sponsorships, and unprecedented **fan engagement**. A pivotal change occurred in 2021 with the introduction of Name, Image, and Likeness (**NIL**) policies, allowing college athletes to profit from endorsements, sponsorships, and personal appearances. This has brought significant financial opportunities for athletes, some signing deals worth millions, fundamentally altering the traditional "**student-athlete**" model.</p>
    <p>Universities are heavily investing in state-of-the-art facilities, attracting top talent, and generating substantial **revenue**. While this professionalization offers new avenues for athletes and universities, it also sparks debates about the balance between academics and athletics, equitable compensation across different sports, and the long-term impact on the collegiate experience. The growth shows no signs of slowing down, solidifying college sports as a major cultural and economic force in American society.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="explanation">
        <h3>1. Conditional Sentences (Type 2: Unreal Present/Future)</h3>

        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Used to talk about hypothetical or imaginary situations in the present or future, and their probable (but unlikely) results. It suggests that the condition is unlikely or impossible to happen.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I mean, if I <b>had</b> a million-dollar contract on the line, my calculus homework <b>might take a backseat</b> to practice drills." (Bob doesn't have a contract, so it's an unreal situation.)</li>
            <li><em>Another example:</em> "If I <b>were</b> a millionaire, I <b>would buy</b> a private jet."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <h3>2. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives/Adverbs</h3>

                    <li>One-syllable adjectives: add -er (e.g., <em>bigger</em>, <em>wilder</em>)</li>
                    <li>Two or more syllables: use <em>more</em> (e.g., <em>more intense</em>, <em>more important</em>)</li>
                    <li>Irregular forms: <em>better</em>, <em>worse</em>, <em>further</em></li>

                    <li>Two or more syllables: use <em>most</em> (e.g., <em>most intense</em>, <em>most important</em>)</li>

        <h3>3. Phrasal Verbs (e.g., 'blown up', 'take a backseat')</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A verb combined with an adverb or a preposition (or sometimes both) to create a new meaning that is often different from the original verb.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> They are very common in informal and conversational English. Understanding their context is key.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Example:</em> "It's wild how much college sports have <b>blown up</b>." (Here, "blown up" means "become very popular/successful suddenly," not "exploded.")</li>
            <li><em>Example:</em> "My calculus homework <b>might take a backseat</b> to practice drills." (Here, "take a backseat" means "become less important/prioritized.")</li>
