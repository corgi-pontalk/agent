    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Hey, Bob! What are you staring at on your phone so intently?</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, Alice! You won't believe this. My new game score... it's huge!</p>
        <p>Alice: How huge? Is it like, fifty points? A hundred?</p>
        <p>Bob: No, no! Much bigger! It's one thousand five hundred and fifty!</p>
        <p>Alice: Wow, that's pretty good, Bob! One thousand five hundred and fifty. Or you could say 'fifteen hundred fifty' too.</p>
        <p>Bob: Really? Fifteen hundred fifty? Cool! And look at this other number... the gold coins I collected. It's... four thousand three hundred seventy-five!</p>
        <p>Alice: Four thousand three hundred and seventy-five? That's a lot of gold coins! You're practically a digital millionaire.</p>
        <p>Bob: I know, right? But my friend, Alex, he has even more. He said he has twenty-eight *thousand* coins!</p>
        <p>Alice: Twenty-eight thousand? That's impressive! That's like twenty-eight piles of a thousand coins each.</p>
        <p>Bob: Exactly! And my other friend, Emily, she said her score was... one hundred *thousand*!</p>
        <p>Alice: Whoa! One hundred thousand? That's a *really* big score! Are you sure?</p>
        <p>Bob: Yes! One hundred thousand, zero, zero, zero. That's how she wrote it.</p>
        <p>Alice: Ah, so that's one hundred thousand. You can also say 'a hundred thousand'. Very cool.</p>
        <p>Bob: So, if I got a truly, truly gigantic score, like... a *million*, how would I say that?</p>
        <p>Alice: A million? Well, that's 'one million'. It's a thousand thousands! Imagine that!</p>
        <p>Bob: Whoa, a thousand thousands! My head just spun. That's a number for superheroes.</p>
        <p>Alice: It certainly is! Maybe one day you'll reach it. Keep practicing those finger taps!</p>
        <p>Bob: I will! Thanks, Alice! Now I can finally understand these super big numbers.</p>
        <p>Alice: Anytime, Bob! Good luck with your game, and remember those numbers!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Reading Numbers Over 1,000</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thousands:</strong> We say the number of thousands followed by "thousand."
                <ul>
                    <li>1,000: <em>one thousand</em></li>
                    <li>5,000: <em>five thousand</em></li>
                    <li>28,000: <em>twenty-eight thousand</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Thousands and Hundreds:</strong> Combine the thousands with the hundreds, tens, and units.
                <ul>
                    <li>1,550: <em>one thousand five hundred fifty</em> (or informally, <em>fifteen hundred fifty</em>)</li>
                    <li>4,375: <em>four thousand three hundred seventy-five</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hundreds of Thousands:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>100,000: <em>one hundred thousand</em> or <em>a hundred thousand</em> (both are common)</li>
                    <li>500,000: <em>five hundred thousand</em></li>
                    <li>120,000: <em>one hundred twenty thousand</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Millions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>1,000,000: <em>one million</em> or <em>a million</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Using Commas (,)</h3>
        <p>In English, we use commas to separate groups of three digits when writing large numbers, starting from the right. This makes them much easier to read!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1,000 (one thousand)</li>
            <li>28,000 (twenty-eight thousand)</li>
            <li>100,000 (one hundred thousand)</li>
            <li>1,000,000 (one million)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. "One/A" vs. Other Numbers</h3>
        <p>When the number of thousands or millions is exactly one, we can use "one" or "a."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can say "one thousand" or "a thousand."</li>
            <li>You can say "one hundred thousand" or "a hundred thousand."</li>
            <li>You can say "one million" or "a million."</li>
            <li>However, for other numbers, we use the specific number: "two thousand," "five hundred thousand," "ten million." (We don't say "a two thousand").</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
