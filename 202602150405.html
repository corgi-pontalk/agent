        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, you look like you're staring at that coffee cup with intense concentration. Are you trying to understand its inner thoughts?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you caught me! I was actually trying to figure out why *that* person keeps tapping their foot. Is it stress? Or just a catchy song in their head?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ah, the mysteries of <strong>human behavior</strong>! That's psychology, Bob! We're like amateur detectives of the mind.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So, if someone smiles a lot, does that mean they are always happy?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Not always! Sometimes people smile to be polite, even if they feel a bit sad inside. It's called a '<strong>social smile</strong>'.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Wow, so a smile can be a secret code!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! And what about <strong>body language</strong>? If someone crosses their arms, what do you think that means?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm, maybe they're cold? Or they don't like my joke?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Could be! In psychology, crossed arms often suggest a 'closed' posture – maybe they're feeling defensive, or simply not <strong>open to</strong> what's happening.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So I should uncross my arms right now to seem more open to learning this!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Smart move! And what about <strong>motivation</strong>? Why do *you* drink so much coffee?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Easy! To stay awake and listen to your fascinating psychology lessons!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good answer! That's an '<strong>extrinsic motivation</strong>' – something outside yourself. You get the coffee, you get the lesson.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So, if I learn because I *love* learning, that's '<strong>intrinsic motivation</strong>'?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You got it, Bob! You're a natural psychologist!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Maybe I should open a 'Mind Reading Cafe'! We could serve coffee and analyze customers.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, I'd be your first customer, Bob. But let's start with observing ourselves first!</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. It helps us understand why people think, feel, and act the way they do. From observing how a baby learns to talk, to understanding why advertisements make us want to buy things, psychology is everywhere.</p>
        <p>It helps us understand ourselves better, improve our relationships, and even solve problems in our daily lives. Basic psychology ideas help us see the world and people around us in a new, interesting way. It's not about reading minds, but about understanding patterns and reasons behind actions and feelings.</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Present Simple for General Truths and Habits</h3>
        <p>We use the Present Simple tense to talk about things that are always true, facts, or things that happen regularly (habits).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form:</strong> Base form of the verb (e.g., walk, study) or base form + -s/-es for he/she/it.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Psychology <strong>studies</strong> human behavior." (a general truth/fact)</li>
                    <li>"People sometimes <strong>smile</strong> to be polite." (a general habit/fact)</li>
                    <li>"He <strong>keeps tapping</strong> his foot." (a regular action/habit)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Verb 'To be' (am/is/are)</h3>
        <p>The verb 'to be' is very common and essential. We use it to describe what someone or something is, where they are, or how they feel.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>I <strong>am</strong></li>
                    <li>You/We/They <strong>are</strong></li>
                    <li>He/She/It <strong>is</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You <strong>are</strong> thoughtful." (describing a state)</li>
                    <li>"That's (That <strong>is</strong>) psychology." (identifying something)</li>
                    <li>"It <strong>is</strong> called a 'social smile'." (describing a fact)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Question Words: What and Why</h3>
        <p>We use question words to ask for specific information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What</strong>: Used to ask about things, information, or definitions.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "<strong>What</strong> do you think that means?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "<strong>What</strong> is your favorite color?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why</strong>: Used to ask for reasons.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "<strong>Why</strong> do *you* drink so much coffee?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "<strong>Why</strong> are you happy?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
