    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, did you hear about the latest doping scandal? Apparently, a marathon runner credited his sudden burst of speed to a new 'super-caffeine' smoothie.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! I saw that! I'm pretty sure my 'super-caffeine' smoothie just makes me want a nap.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! He probably just had an espresso IV drip. It's getting ridiculous.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It's like a real-life cartoon sometimes. Remember that cyclist who swore his improved performance was due to a 'lucky charm' in his water bottle? Turned out the charm was a microscopic vial of EPO.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, the 'magic pebble' incident! My personal favourite was the swimmer who claimed the chlorine in the pool gave him superhuman lung capacity. Sure, and I can fly if I flap my arms hard enough.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I wonder what excuse they'll come up with next. 'My sweat glands accidentally produced pure testosterone'? Or 'I just had a really good night's sleep... for three years'?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Don't give them ideas, Bob! It's like they're trying to win an Olympic medal for the most creative denial.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Maybe they should have a separate competition: 'Most Unbelievable Doping Excuse.' That would be entertaining.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I'd watch that! Gold medal for the guy who blamed his positive test on second-hand smoke from a unicorn.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Or the athlete who said his muscles spontaneously grew because he listened to too much motivational pop music.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: It's a serious issue, though, isn't it? It just undermines the whole spirit of fair play.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Absolutely. When you see someone achieve something incredible, you want to believe it's pure talent and hard work, not pharmaceuticals.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Right. It makes you question every record, every medal. It's such a shame for the clean athletes.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hopefully, with better testing and harsher penalties, we'll see fewer of these headlines.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Fingers crossed, Bob. Maybe one day 'natural talent' won't be a scandalous excuse.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Doping scandals remain a persistent and significant challenge in international sports. Despite the efforts of organizations like the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to implement stringent testing protocols and enforce strict penalties, athletes continue to seek illicit advantages. The desire for success, fame, and financial rewards can push some individuals to use performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).</p>
    <p>These substances range from anabolic steroids and human growth hormones to EPO (Erythropoietin) and various stimulants, often combined with masking agents to evade detection. The anti-doping battle is a constant cat-and-mouse game, with scientists developing new detection methods while some athletes and their support teams devise new ways to cheat.</p>
    <p>The impact of doping is profound: it tarnishes the reputation of athletes, undermines the integrity of sports, casts doubt on legitimate achievements, and discourages clean athletes who compete fairly. Major events like the Olympics and World Championships are frequently marred by revelations, leading to medal stripping, bans, and public outcry, reinforcing the need for continuous vigilance and education.</p>

    <p>Modal verbs like <em>must</em>, <em>might</em>, <em>could</em>, <em>should</em>, and phrases like <em>probably</em> are used to express how certain we are about something, or to make deductions based on evidence or general knowledge.</p>

        <li><strong>Must / Probably</strong>: Used when you are almost certain something is true.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: Alice: He <strong>probably</strong> just had an espresso IV drip. (Alice is quite sure)</em></p>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning, often different from the original verb's meaning.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Come up with</strong>: To invent or think of an idea, plan, suggestion, or excuse.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: Bob: I wonder what excuse they'll <strong>come up with</strong> next.</em></p>
