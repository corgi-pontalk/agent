Alice: Oh, Bob, I really need to pop into this pharmacy for a second.
Bob: Alice! Are you okay? What's wrong? Do you have a fever? Is it serious?! You look... fine, actually. But maybe it's an invisible sickness!
Alice: (Laughing) No, Bob, I'm perfectly fine! I just ran out of my special 'happy feet' cream. My feet get so tired after work.
Bob: Happy feet cream? Is that like... medicine for sad feet? Do they sing? Or dance?
Alice: It just makes them feel good! It's a special cooling cream. Excuse me, do you have any foot cream? Pharmacist: (Walks over) Hello! Yes, we have many kinds. Are you looking for something specific, like a cooling cream or a moisturizer?
Alice: Yes, a cooling cream, please. Something for tired feet. Pharmacist: I see. We have this one. It's very popular. It has mint and eucalyptus. Would you like to try it?
Alice: Oh, perfect! That sounds lovely. How much is it? Pharmacist: It's 9 dollars and 50 cents.
Bob: Wow, 9 dollars for happy feet! Mine are usually happy for free. Maybe I should get some. Do they make your whole body happy?
Alice: (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly) Just the feet, Bob. Just the feet. Yes, I'll take it, please. Pharmacist: Great! Anything else today?
Alice: No, thank you! That's all.
Bob: So, Alice, after this, are we going to see your feet do a little happy dance?
