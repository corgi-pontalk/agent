    <h2>Dialogue</h2>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what? I just saw a calendar! It's almost festival time!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Calendar? Are you sure it wasn't a really fancy pizza menu? You're always thinking about food.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, very funny! No, it really said 'Autumn Festival next month'! What's your favorite festival?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, an autumn festival! Hmm, my favorite... definitely the 'Sleep-in-until-noon Festival' every weekend. It's a classic.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That's not a real festival, Bob! I mean a <em>celebration</em> with food and music!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, okay! If I have to pick a <em>real</em> one, I love the Spring Blossom Festival. All the flowers are beautiful.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ah, the Spring Blossom Festival is lovely! My favorite is the 'Food Truck Fiesta' in July. So many delicious smells!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Of course it is, Alice. Anything with 'food' in the name! Do you remember that time you tried to eat a whole giant pretzel by yourself?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey! I almost did it! It was a <em>festival</em> pretzel! Anyway, what do people usually <em>do</em> at the Spring Blossom Festival?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, they go for picnics under the trees, take lots of photos, and there's often traditional music. It's quite relaxing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Sounds nice. At the Food Truck Fiesta, people eat, listen to live bands, and sometimes there are even cooking contests.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Cooking contests! I bet you're always a judge, right? "Yes, this burger needs more cheese, please!"</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Maybe! Do you ever <em>dress up</em> for festivals?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Sometimes! For the Halloween festival, I was a zombie last year. It was a bit messy, but fun!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, Halloween is fun! I was a witch. My hat kept falling off.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You'd make a great witch, Alice. Just add a giant cauldron for all your festival snacks!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Alright, Mr. Funny! Are there any festivals you <em>don't</em> like?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm, I'm not a big fan of the 'Early Morning Marathon Festival.' Too much running, not enough eating.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, I agree! I don't like festivals where it's too crowded. I can't find the food trucks!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Priorities, Alice, priorities! So, about this Autumn Festival... what kind of food do you think they'll have?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Pumpkin pie, apple cider, roasted corn... My mouth is watering just thinking about it!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Sounds like a plan! We should definitely go together. Maybe I can find a new 'favorite festival' that day.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Perfect! But only if you promise not to try and eat a flower.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Deal! Unless it's a giant edible flower made of candy. Then all bets are off!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You're impossible! See you there, Bob!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Bye, Alice! Don't eat all the pumpkin pie before I get there!</p>
