Alice : Bob, this new restaurant looks amazing! I'm so excited to try it. Bob : Alice, I'm absolutely starving! My stomach is making strange noises. Alice : Haha! Well, let's find a table. Oh, this one looks good by the window. Bob : Perfect! So, what are you in the mood for? I could eat a horse. Alice : A horse? Wow, you _are_ hungry! I think I'll have the pasta. It sounds delicious. Bob : Pasta? Hmm, I saw a giant burger on the menu. That’s my kind of food! Alice : Of course it is, Bob. You always go for the biggest thing! Bob : It's called "The Everest Burger"! How can I resist? Alice : Good luck climbing that mountain! I’ll just have a small salad to start, then the pasta. Bob : Salad? Are you sure you're at the right place? This isn't a rabbit cafe! Alice : It's a nice start! Maybe I’ll share a fry or two from your Everest. Bob : Only if you promise not to tell anyone I shared my fries. It’s a secret mission. Alice : Deal! Oh, here comes the waiter. Are you ready to order, Captain Everest? Bob : Ready as I'll ever be! I'm going to conquer that burger. Alice : Good luck, Bob! I hope it's as good as it sounds.
