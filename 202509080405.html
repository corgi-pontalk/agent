    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Hi Bob! Wow, you look like a very sleepy cat today. Did you just wake up?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Alice, you know me too well! Yes, I did. My bed is just too comfy.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Too comfy? I wake up at 6 AM every day! The sun is my alarm clock.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Six AM?! Alice, that's still the middle of the night for me! I usually wake up around 9 AM.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Nine AM! What do you do then? I already finished my yoga and had a big, healthy breakfast.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> I... uh... I usually eat breakfast then. Maybe a giant bowl of cereal. And then I think about taking a nap.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> A nap after breakfast? Bob, you're amazing! I eat lunch around 1 PM. What about you?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Oh, lunch. I usually eat lunch a bit later, around 2 PM. After my "morning" nap, of course.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> (Laughing) You are truly a master of relaxation! Do you ever do anything else?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Sure! I eat dinner around 7 PM. And then I watch some TV.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> And when do you go to sleep? Do you sleep early after all that relaxing?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Hmm, I usually go to sleep around 11 PM. But sometimes I read a book until midnight.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> So, you wake up late, eat late, nap, and then sleep late. You have a very... relaxed routine, Bob!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> It's a special routine, Alice. It works for me! What about you, when do you go to sleep?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> I go to sleep at 10 PM. Gotta get those 8 hours! Good night, Bob! Or, good morning for you!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> (Yawns) Good... everything, Alice! See you later!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>This dialogue shows how two friends, Alice and Bob, describe their "daily routines." Daily routines are the things we do every day, often at the same time. Learning to talk about your routine is very important for everyday English conversations. Alice has an early and active routine, while Bob has a more relaxed and late routine. They use simple English to discuss when they wake up, eat meals, and go to sleep.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>1. Simple Present Tense for Routines</h3>
            <p>We use the Simple Present tense to talk about habits, routines, and things that happen regularly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I / You / We / They + verb (base form)</strong>
                    <p class="example-sentence"><em>I <span class="answer">wake up</span> at 6 AM.</em></p>
                    <p class="example-sentence"><em>We <span class="answer">eat lunch</span> together.</em></p>
                </li>

                    <p class="example-sentence"><em>She <span class="answer">eats</span> a healthy breakfast.</em></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>2. Time Expressions</h3>
            <p>Use these words to talk about when things happen:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>at + specific time</strong>: <span class="example-sentence"><em>at 6 AM, at 7 PM</em></span></li>
                <li><strong>around + approximate time</strong>: <span class="example-sentence"><em>around 9 AM, around 11 PM</em></span></li>

        <li>
            <h3>3. Adverbs of Frequency (usually, sometimes)</h3>
            <p>These words tell us how often something happens. They usually go before the main verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>usually</strong>: <span class="example-sentence"><em>I <span class="answer">usually</span> wake up around 9 AM.</em></span> (most of the time)</li>
                <li><strong>sometimes</strong>: <span class="example-sentence"><em>I <span class="answer">sometimes</span> read a book until midnight.</em></span> (not always, not often)</li>
            </ul>
