        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, you look like you've just seen a ghost, or maybe read a very long book!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice! You got it! I just tried to read 'War and Peace.' It's... a real <b>tome</b>!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: A <b>tome</b>? Wow, big words! Were you trying to impress me with your new <b>vocabulary</b>?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Maybe a little! I also learned about a '<b>protagonist</b>.' That's the main good guy, right?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Mostly, yes! The main character. And the '<b>antagonist</b>' is often the not-so-good guy who opposes them.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Aha! So, in my life, I'm the protagonist, and my alarm clock is the antagonist!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Haha, a perfect '<b>metaphor</b>' for early mornings! A metaphor is when you compare two different things without using 'like' or 'as'.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: So, my life is a '<b>narrative</b>'?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Indeed! A story. And your alarm clock's story is probably a short 'tragedy' every morning.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: And if I write about it, that's a '<b>memoir</b>'?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: If it's about your own life, yes! Like a personal '<b>biography</b>' but written by you.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: So many words! I feel like I need a <b>dictionary</b> just to talk about books!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: You're getting there! You're building your <b>vocabulary</b>. Want to read a short <b>novel</b> together?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Only if it has a happy <b>ending</b>! And not too many <b>chapters</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Deal! Let's find a fun 'fairy tale' or a light 'mystery' for starters.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Great! My brain needs a break from 'epics'.</p>

    <p>Learning literature vocabulary is a fantastic step for English beginners! Even if you're not planning to become a literary critic, these words help you understand and talk about stories, books, movies, and even everyday events. Many of these terms (like 'protagonist' or 'narrative') are not just for high literature; they appear in casual conversations and news reports. Building this vocabulary will make reading and understanding English content much easier and more enjoyable, opening up a whole new world of stories for you!</p>

    <h2 id="grammar-points">Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-points">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Nouns</b>: These are words that name people, places, things, or ideas. In our dialogue, you saw many new nouns related to literature:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>People/Characters</i>: <b>protagonist, antagonist, Alice, Bob</b></li>
                    <li><i>Things/Books</i>: <b>tome, novel, chapter, dictionary, book</b></li>
                    <li><i>Ideas/Concepts</i>: <b>metaphor, narrative, memoir, vocabulary, ending</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nouns are essential for talking about anything. We use them as the subjects of sentences (who or what is doing something) and as objects (who or what is receiving the action).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "The <b>book</b> is on the <b>table</b>." (Book = subject, table = object of preposition)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Adjectives</b>: These are words that describe or modify nouns. They tell us more about the noun's qualities.
                <ul>
                    <li>In the dialogue: <b>long</b> book, <b>big</b> words, <b>main</b> character, <b>good</b> guy, <b>not-so-good</b> guy, <b>perfect</b> metaphor, <b>short</b> tragedy, <b>personal</b> biography, <b>happy</b> ending, <b>fun</b> fairy tale, <b>light</b> mystery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Adjectives usually come before the noun they describe.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "It was a <b>beautiful</b> day."</li>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "The <b>red</b> car is fast."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Simple Present Tense</b>: We use the simple present tense for actions that happen regularly, for facts, and for general truths.
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Examples from dialogue</i>: "It <b>is</b> a real tome." (Fact) / "That's the main good guy, right?" (General truth) / "Reading books <b>can help</b> improve your vocabulary." (General truth/habit)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The form is usually the base form of the verb (e.g., 'read', 'talk', 'be'). For 'he', 'she', 'it', we add '-s' or '-es' to the verb (e.g., 'he reads', 'she talks', 'it is').</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "I <b>read</b> every day."</li>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "She <b>likes</b> chocolate."</li>
