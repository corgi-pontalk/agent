## Dialogue Alice : Bob, did you see the latest news about 'GreenCo'? They're now only using single-ply toilet paper in the office to save trees. Bob : Alice, I did! And they're calling it a "bold step towards a zero- waste future." My future self is just going to be very uncomfortable. Alice : Right? I heard their CEO is now commuting on a unicycle. Apparently, it's "optimizing carbon footprint reduction." Bob : A unicycle? I'd pay good money to see that. My company just switched to reusable coffee cups, but half the staff keep forgetting them, so we end up using paper ones anyway. It’s like we’re taking one step forward and two steps back. Alice : That sounds about right. It feels like every business is scrambling to be 'sustainable' these days. My boss keeps talking about "eco-friendly packaging" for our products, but then he orders 500 new plastic pens for the office. Bob : Classic corporate contradiction! My favorite is when they install motion-sensor lights in the bathroom, but then leave the main office lights on all night. Talk about greenwashing. Alice : Oh, tell me about it! Our marketing team is currently trying to figure out how to make our new range of plastic garden gnomes sound 'ethically sourced '. Bob : Plastic garden gnomes? Alice, that's a tough sell. Maybe they could say they're made from "recycled hopes and dreams of garden elves"? Alice : Haha, I'll pass that on! But seriously, it's good that companies are *trying*, even if some efforts are a bit... performative. Bob : Absolutely. I mean, reducing waste, conserving energy, sourcing ethically – these are genuinely important. It’s just finding that sweet spot between genuine impact and not making everyone miserable with single-ply. Alice : Or making the CEO fall off a unicycle. I think the key is integrated solutions, not just token gestures. Bob : Exactly! Like, why not invest in proper recycling infrastructure instead of just telling people to 'be greener'? Alice : Or supporting local, sustainable suppliers. That actually makes a difference. Bob : Agreed. It’s more than just a marketing buzzword; it’s about rethinking the whole business model. Alice : You're right. Maybe I should suggest a company-wide 'bring your own garden gnome' policy. Now *that's* sustainable. Bob : And potentially hilarious. I'm in favour! Alice : You always are, Bob. You always are.
