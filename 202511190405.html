    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what I did last weekend!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm, Alice, let me guess... you finally cleaned your apartment?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey! No, something much more exciting! I went to Redwood National Park!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Redwood? Is that where those giant trees live? Sounds... tall.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! It was amazing. The trees are huge, like nature's skyscrapers.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Skyscrapers, huh? I prefer the ones with cafes and Wi-Fi.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, come on! There's fresh air, hiking trails, maybe even some deer!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Deer? I saw a squirrel once in the city park. Does that count?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Not quite! You should really go. It's so peaceful, no traffic, just birds singing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Birds? My alarm clock sings every morning. Very loud birds.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You're impossible! But seriously, it's good for your soul. You can disconnect.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Disconnect? My phone battery would cry! But... tell me more about these 'giant trees'.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: They're ancient, majestic. You feel so small next to them. It's humbling.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Small? I already feel small next to my laundry pile. But 'humbling' sounds interesting.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, next time, National Park trip? My treat!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm, your treat, you say? Maybe... if there's a good snack bar at the visitor center.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>National parks are protected areas of natural beauty, historical significance, or scientific interest. They are managed by governments to preserve wilderness, wildlife, and natural resources for future generations, while also offering opportunities for public recreation and education. Many countries around the world have national park systems, such as the U.S. National Park Service or Parks Canada, attracting millions of visitors who enjoy activities like hiking, camping, and wildlife viewing. These parks play a crucial role in conservation and provide important spaces for people to connect with nature.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3><span class="grammar-point-title">1. Present Simple Tense</span></h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about habits, routines, general facts, and things that are always true.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + base verb (add -s or -es for he/she/it).</li>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"The trees <strong>are</strong> huge." (General fact using 'to be')</li>
                <li>"I <strong>prefer</strong> the ones with cafes." (A preference)</li>
                <li>"It's so peaceful, no traffic, just birds <strong>singing</strong>." (A general truth/description)</li>
                <li>"My alarm clock <strong>sings</strong> every morning." (A habit/routine)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rule:</strong> For "I, you, we, they", use the base verb (e.g., I like, they go). For "he, she, it", add -s or -es (e.g., he likes, she goes).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="grammar-point-title">2. Modal Verb "Should"</span></h3>
    <p>"Should" is used to give advice, make recommendations, or express what is correct or appropriate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + should + base verb (without "to").</li>
        <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"You <strong>should</strong> really <strong>go</strong>." (Alice is recommending Bob visit the park.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rule:</strong> "Should" is followed by the base form of the verb. It does not change for different subjects (e.g., I should go, he should go).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="grammar-point-title">3. Adjectives for Description</span></h3>
    <p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns (people, places, things) or pronouns. They add more detail to your sentences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Before a noun: "those <strong>giant</strong> trees"</li>
                <li>After the verb "to be" (is, am, are): "It <strong>was amazing</strong>." "The trees <strong>are huge</strong>." "It's so <strong>peaceful</strong>."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>amazing</strong> (very good, wonderful)</li>
                <li><strong>huge</strong> (very big)</li>
                <li><strong>fresh</strong> (clean, new)</li>
                <li><strong>peaceful</strong> (calm, quiet)</li>
                <li><strong>ancient</strong> (very old)</li>
                <li><strong>majestic</strong> (impressive and beautiful)</li>
                <li><strong>humbling</strong> (making you feel less important, in a good way)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
