Alice : Hey Bob, guess what just happened with my brother! Bob : Oh Alice, tell me, is he trying to teach a cat to fetch again? Alice : Worse! My sister just tried to dye my dog pink! Bob : Wow, your family sounds wild! My mom would freak out if I did that. Alice : Mine too! My dad just sighed and said, 'Not again, kids.' Bob : Haha! My dad once tried to cook Thanksgiving dinner. Let's just say we ordered pizza. Alice : That sounds familiar! My grandma is an amazing cook, but my grandpa only makes toast. Bob : Lucky! My grandparents live far away, but they send the best cookies. Alice : Aww! My aunt sends me funny postcards from her travels. Bob : Cool! My uncle collects rubber ducks. Seriously, he has hundreds. Alice : A rubber duck uncle? That's amazing! So, I have a pink-dog-dyeing sister, a crazy brother, a sighing dad, and a cooking-queen grandma. Bob : And I have a freak-out mom, a pizza-ordering dad, cookie-sending grandparents, and a duck-collecting uncle. Alice : Our families are... unique. Bob : Definitely! But I wouldn't trade them for anything. Alice : Me neither! Even the pink-dog-dyeing part. Bob : Good to know! Just don't let them near my cat.
