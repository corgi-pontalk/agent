    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, <span class="important-word">Bob</span>, you look a bit green! Are you okay?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Hi <span class="important-word">Alice</span>. Not really. I think I've <span class="important-word">caught something</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no! A <span class="important-word">cold</span>? A <span class="important-word">flu</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: I don't know. My throat is a little <span class="important-word">sore</span>, and I keep <span class="important-word">sneezing</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hmm, sounds like a cold. Did you take any <span class="important-word">medicine</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Not yet. I hate taking <span class="important-word">pills</span>. They're so big!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: You big baby! You <span class="important-word">need to take care of yourself</span>. Maybe a <span class="important-word">pain reliever</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: I was hoping a big slice of pizza would fix it.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Pizza is not medicine, Bob! You <span class="important-word">should drink lots of water</span> and <span class="important-word">get some rest</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: But I have so much to do! Like watching my new show...</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: No, rest is important for your <span class="important-word">recovery</span>. Do you have a <span class="important-word">fever</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: I don't think so. I feel a bit warm, but no thermometer.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: You should check! Maybe you need to <span class="important-word">see a doctor</span> if it gets worse.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: A doctor? For a sniffle? No way! They'll tell me to eat vegetables.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Well, <span class="important-word">eating healthy</span> is good for your <span class="important-word">immune system</span>, you know.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: So, no more pizza for my immune system?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Moderation, Bob! And maybe some <span class="important-word">vitamin C</span>. Orange juice?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, fine. Orange juice sounds better than a pill.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Good. And remember to <span class="important-word">wash your hands</span> often to <span class="important-word">prevent spreading germs</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, right! I don't want to make anyone else sick.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly. <span class="important-word">Being healthy</span> isn't just about feeling good, it's about being responsible.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: You're right. Maybe I'll go home and <span class="important-word">take a nap</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: That's a good idea! And try to avoid sugary drinks for now.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: No soda? This is a tough recovery.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Think of it as a health challenge! You can do it.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, okay. Thanks for the advice, Dr. Alice.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Anytime, patient Bob! Just <span class="important-word">get well soon</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: I'll try my best. And maybe I'll eat an apple tomorrow.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: One apple a day keeps the doctor away, they say!</p>
