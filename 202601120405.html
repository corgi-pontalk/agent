    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what? I have an incredible product for you!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, Alice? What secret offer do you have this time? Is it another "guaranteed success" juice blender?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: No, no! This is better! It's my legendary 'Lucky Charm Rock'! It's one of a kind.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Your... rock? How much does this product cost? Is there a discount for friends?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: For you, Bob, a special price of only $20! And it's usually $50! That's a huge sale!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: $20 for a rock? Alice, it looks like a regular rock from my garden. And it has a dent.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That's a "character mark"! It proves its age and wisdom. It brings good fortune!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm, I'm not sure I'm the right customer for a dented, wise rock. What if I want to return it?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: No returns! But I can give you a deal on a second, slightly smaller, 'Luckier Charm Pebble'!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You're really trying to sell this, aren't you? What's your target audience for these? Rocks?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: People who need luck, Bob! Imagine the value!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I see. So, if I buy it, do I get a receipt? For my tax records, you know.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Of course! A handwritten one! So, do we have a deal? You'll be the happiest customer!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, okay, you drive a hard bargain, Alice. But only if you throw in a free hug.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Deal! You're an amazing customer! And a cheap date for rocks.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Understanding basic sales vocabulary is very useful, even for beginners! Whether you're shopping for groceries, buying clothes, or even just browsing online, you'll encounter these words every day. Knowing them helps you understand prices, find good deals, and communicate what you want to buy or sell. It makes everyday transactions much easier and more fun, both when you are the buyer and sometimes, like Alice, when you are the seller!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Simple Present Tense (for actions and facts)</h3>
    <p>We use the Simple Present Tense to talk about things that happen regularly, general truths, or facts. In sales, it's common for describing prices, products, and actions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"It costs..."</strong>: Used for the price of one item (singular noun).
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: This rock <em>costs</em> $20.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"They cost..."</strong>: Used for the price of multiple items (plural noun).
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: The shoes <em>cost</em> $50.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"I sell..." / "You buy..."</strong>: Describes the actions of selling and buying.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: I <em>sell</em> old books. You <em>buy</em> a new phone.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Asking about Price: "How much...?"</h3>
    <p>This is the most common way to ask about the price of something.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"How much does it cost?"</strong> (for one item)
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>How much does</em> this product <em>cost</em>?</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"How much are they?"</strong> (for multiple items)
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>How much are</em> these apples?</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"What is the price?"</strong> (also common, for one item)
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>What is the price</em> of this car?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Making Requests or Stating Intentions: "I want to..." / "Can I get...?"</h3>
    <p>When you are a customer, you often need to express what you want to buy or do.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"I want to buy..."</strong>: Clearly states your desire to purchase something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>I want to buy</em> a new laptop.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"Can I get...?"</strong>: A polite way to ask for an item.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>Can I get</em> a receipt, please?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
