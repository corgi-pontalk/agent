Alice : Oh no, Bob! My lucky purple sock is gone! Bob : Alice? Your... lucky purple sock? The one with the tiny avocado? Alice : Exactly! I think I left it at the coffee shop. This is a disaster! Bob : A disaster? It's just one sock. Don't you have another? Alice : No! It's part of a very special pair. I can't wear a single avocado sock! Bob : Okay, okay. Let's go back to "The Daily Grind." Maybe someone found it. Alice : You're the best, Bob! What should I say when we get there? Bob : You can ask, "Did anyone find a lost item?" or "I lost something here." Alice : Good idea! I hope they have a "lost and found" box. Bob : Usually, places like that do. Fingers crossed! _(Later, at the coffee shop)_ Alice : Excuse me, I lost something here earlier. Did anyone find a purple sock? Barista : A purple sock with a small avocado? Yes, we have it! It's right here in our lost and found! Alice : Oh, thank goodness! My lucky sock! Thank you so much! Bob : See, Alice? Not a disaster after all. Now, where's its lonely partner? Alice : Shhh, Bob! It's a mystery for another day. Let's celebrate with more coffee! * * *
