Alice: Bob, guess what I did last weekend!
Bob: Hmm, Alice, let me guess... you finally cleaned your apartment?
Alice: Hey! No, something much more exciting! I went to Redwood National Park!
Bob: Redwood? Is that where those giant trees live? Sounds... tall.
Alice: Exactly! It was amazing. The trees are huge, like nature's skyscrapers.
Bob: Skyscrapers, huh? I prefer the ones with cafes and Wi-Fi.
Alice: Oh, come on! There's fresh air, hiking trails, maybe even some deer!
Bob: Deer? I saw a squirrel once in the city park. Does that count?
Alice: Not quite! You should really go. It's so peaceful, no traffic, just birds singing.
Bob: Birds? My alarm clock sings every morning. Very loud birds.
Alice: You're impossible! But seriously, it's good for your soul. You can disconnect.
Bob: Disconnect? My phone battery would cry! But... tell me more about these 'giant trees'.
Alice: They're ancient, majestic. You feel so small next to them. It's humbling.
Bob: Small? I already feel small next to my laundry pile. But 'humbling' sounds interesting.
Alice: So, next time, National Park trip? My treat!
Bob: Hmm, your treat, you say? Maybe... if there's a good snack bar at the visitor center.
