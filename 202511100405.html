        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, you won't believe my trip!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, Alice! Tell me everything. Good, I hope?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good? Ha! My flight was delayed... for five hours!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Five hours? That's awful! What did you do?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I read a whole book, ate three airport cookies, and almost learned to juggle with two oranges I bought.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Almost learned to juggle? That sounds like a very long delay!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: It was! But wait, there's more. When I finally landed, guess what?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Your luggage... it didn't arrive?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bingo! My bright pink suitcase, gone! Poof!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh no! Not the pink one! Did they find it?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Eventually, yes. Three days later. It went on its own adventure to Hawaii, apparently.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hawaii? Lucky suitcase! Did you get a tan without it?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Very funny! I had to buy new clothes. My vacation started with an unplanned shopping spree.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, at least you got some new outfits! So, next trip by train?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe a hot air balloon! Less chance of lost luggage, right?</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <div class="current-situation">
            <p>Travel can be very exciting, but sometimes problems happen. Two common issues for travelers are <b>flight delays</b> and <b>lost luggage</b>. A flight delay means your airplane leaves later than its scheduled time. This can happen for many reasons, like bad weather, technical problems with the plane, or air traffic control issues. Lost luggage means your suitcase or bag doesn't arrive at your destination with you. While these situations can be frustrating, airlines usually have procedures to help. They often work to find your lost bags and send them to you, or they might rebook you on another flight if yours is delayed too long. Knowing about these common issues can help you be better prepared!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Past Simple Tense</h3>
                <p>We use the <b>Past Simple tense</b> to talk about actions that started and finished in the past. It's very common when telling a story or describing past events, like Alice telling Bob about her trip.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Regular verbs:</b> Add -ed to the base form (e.g., <em>delay</em> &rarr; <em>delayed</em>, <em>land</em> &rarr; <em>landed</em>, <em>wait</em> &rarr; <em>waited</em>).</li>
                    <li><b>Irregular verbs:</b> Change form (e.g., <em>be</em> &rarr; <em>was/were</em>, <em>eat</em> &rarr; <em>ate</em>, <em>buy</em> &rarr; <em>bought</em>, <em>go</em> &rarr; <em>went</em>, <em>have</em> &rarr; <em>had</em>).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="example-sentence">Examples from dialogue: "My flight <b>was delayed</b>." "I <b>read</b> a whole book, <b>ate</b> three airport cookies, and <b>bought</b> two oranges." "My suitcase <b>went</b> on its own adventure."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Expressions of Surprise and Disbelief</h3>
                <p>These phrases help you show your feelings when something unexpected or remarkable happens in a conversation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>You won't believe</b>: Use this to introduce something very surprising or incredible. It makes the listener curious.</li>
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: "You won't believe my trip!"</p>
                    <li><b>That's awful!</b>: Use this to show sympathy or express that something is very bad or unfortunate.</li>
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Five hours? That's awful!"</p>
                    <li><b>Oh no!</b>: Use this to express worry, disappointment, or shock about something bad.</li>
