        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob! Is that really you?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! Wow, long time no see! How have you been?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> I'm great, thanks! You too! How do you usually keep in touch with everyone? My phone is always busy!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Haha, tell me about it! I mostly text my friends. It's fast and easy.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> True. I like video calls too, especially with family far away. It's nice to see their faces.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oh yeah, video calls are great! I use them for my sister who lives abroad. We chat every weekend.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> That’s good! Sometimes I forget to reply to messages for days. My friends think I've disappeared!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Don't worry, Alice, you're not alone! I once replied to a "Happy New Year" text in February. My friend just sent back a "LOL."</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> (Laughing) That's even worse than me! I guess we're both a bit forgetful.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Maybe we need a personal assistant just for keeping in touch!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Or maybe we should just make more time. Like, "Hey Bob, let's grab coffee next week!"</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> That's a fantastic idea! I'd love to catch up properly.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Me too! I'll text you later to set a time.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Sounds good! Don't forget to send that text, okay? No February replies!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> (Smiling) I promise! It was great running into you!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> You too, Alice! Talk soon!</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>In today's fast-paced world, staying connected with friends and family is easier than ever before. With smartphones and the internet, we have many tools at our fingertips. People use different methods to <span class="key-phrase">keep in touch</span>, depending on who they are communicating with and how urgent or personal the message is.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">Text messages (SMS/Messaging Apps):</span> This is one of the most common ways to send quick updates, share links, or just say hello. Apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and iMessage are widely used.</li>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">Phone calls:</span> For longer conversations or when you need to hear someone's voice, a direct phone call is still very popular.</li>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">Video calls:</span> When you want to see someone's face, especially with family or friends who live far away, video calls (using apps like Zoom, FaceTime, or Google Meet) are perfect.</li>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">Social Media:</span> Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter allow people to share updates about their lives, see what others are doing, and send private messages.</li>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">Emails:</span> For more formal communication or longer messages, email remains a standard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choosing the right method helps us maintain strong relationships and ensures we can <span class="key-phrase">catch up</span> and support each other, even when we can't be together physically.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. The Simple Present Tense for Habits and Routines</h3>
        <p>We use the <span class="grammar-point">Simple Present Tense</span> to talk about things we do regularly or as a habit. It's perfect for discussing how you usually keep in touch.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">Subject + Verb (base form)</span> for I, You, We, They.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: I <span class="grammar-point">text</span> my friends every day.</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: We <span class="grammar-point">chat</span> every weekend.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">Subject + Verb-s/-es</span> for He, She, It.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: She often <span class="grammar-point">forgets</span> to reply.</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: He usually <span class="grammar-point">calls</span> his parents.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">Questions:</span> Do/Does + Subject + Verb (base form)?
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: <span class="grammar-point">How do you usually</span> keep in touch?</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: <span class="grammar-point">Does she</span> use video calls?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> When the subject is He/She/It, we add -s or -es to the verb. For questions with He/She/It, we use "Does".</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. "Let's" for Suggestions</h3>
        <p>We use <span class="grammar-point">"Let's"</span> (short for "Let us") to make suggestions about what "we" should do. It's followed by the base form of a verb.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">Let's + Verb (base form)</span>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: <span class="grammar-point">Let's grab</span> coffee next week!</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: <span class="grammar-point">Let's catch up</span> soon.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Adverbs of Frequency (e.g., usually, often, sometimes)</h3>
        <p>These words tell us how often something happens. They usually go before the main verb (except for the verb "to be").</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">Subject + Adverb + Main Verb</span>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: I <span class="grammar-point">mostly text</span> my friends.</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: We <span class="grammar-point">often have</span> a video call.</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: Sometimes <span class="grammar-point">I forget</span> to reply. (Can also be at the beginning or end of sentence)</p>
            </li>
