Alice : Bob, guess what I saw? This tiny, tiny cupcake for... ten dollars! Bob : Ten dollars? Alice, that's insane! Was it made of gold? Alice : Almost! It was just a regular vanilla cupcake. I couldn't believe it. Bob : Wow. That's way too much for a cupcake. I bought this new hat yesterday, and it was only five dollars. Alice : Only five dollars? That's a great deal, Bob! It looks good on you. Bob : Thanks! I thought so too. How much was your coffee this morning? Alice : Mine was three dollars. A bit expensive for just black coffee, but it was really good. Bob : Three dollars isn't too bad if it's good coffee. But ten dollars for a cupcake... I'm still thinking about it! Alice : I know, right? It makes my coffee feel cheap! What about that new game you wanted? How much is it? Bob : Oh, 'Galactic Sweeper'? It's fifty dollars. A bit pricey, but I really want it. Alice : Fifty dollars... that's quite a lot. Are you sure it's worth it? Bob : I hope so! Maybe I'll wait for a sale. How much is a movie ticket these days? Alice : Around twelve dollars here. But popcorn is like, eight dollars! Bob : Eight dollars for popcorn? That's crazy! Maybe I should just bring my own snacks. Alice : Good idea, Bob! We should start a 'cheap snacks for movies' club.
