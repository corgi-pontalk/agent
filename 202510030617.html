    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, did you see the news about NASA's Artemis III preparations? They're really gearing up!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! You know I live for space news! What's the latest? Are they finally sending me to the moon? Because I've packed my space-themed socks.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (chuckles) Not quite *you*, Bob, unless you've secretly become an astronaut in your spare time. But yes, Artemis III is on track to land humans on the Moon again, possibly by 2026. This time, they're aiming for the lunar south pole.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> The south pole? So, no moon golf on the Sea of Tranquility then? My dreams of hitting a hole-in-one with low gravity are shattered!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's more about scientific research, like looking for water ice, which could be crucial for a sustained lunar presence. Astronauts are undergoing countless hours of training for this mission. It's a huge undertaking.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Water ice! So, moon-sicles? Or a moon-sized ice rink? I'm sensing a theme here. And "sustained lunar presence"... does that mean moon bases? Like in the movies?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! The long-term goal is to establish a permanent presence, not just fleeting visits. It's also a stepping stone for future missions to Mars. They're still ironing out the kinks with the Orion capsule and the Space Launch System, of course.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A stepping stone to Mars! Wow. So, I need to train for Mars next, then. What kind of training? Eating dehydrated food? Practicing saying "Houston, we have a problem" with a dramatic pause?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> More like advanced geology, robotics, and survival skills. And teamwork, Bob. Lots of teamwork. It's an international effort, with partners like the European Space Agency.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Teamwork, got it. So, no solo moon-walks with a selfie stick then. That's a bummer. But still, the idea of humans walking on the moon again, pushing the boundaries of exploration... I'm over the moon about it!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I knew you'd get a kick out of it. It's a monumental achievement in the making. Imagine being one of the first humans to explore an entirely new region of the Moon!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I *am* imagining it! And I'm also imagining the incredible photos. Just think, the first woman and first person of color on the Moon. That's groundbreaking!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely. It's not just about space; it's about expanding humanity's reach and inspiring future generations. It's no small feat, and a lot of work is still ahead.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> You're right. It makes my space-themed socks feel even more significant. I'll just wear them and cheer from Earth for now.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> That's the spirit! And who knows, maybe one day they'll need a chief moon-golf course designer. Keep those socks handy!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>NASA's Artemis III mission is a pivotal component of the broader Artemis program, aiming to return humans to the Moon for the first time since 1972. Slated for as early as 2026, this mission plans to land the first woman and first person of color at the lunar south pole. This region is of particular scientific interest due to the potential presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters, which could be vital for future lunar outposts and long-duration space missions, including those to Mars. Preparations are in full swing, involving extensive astronaut training, development and testing of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, and the Human Landing System (HLS) being developed by SpaceX. The mission represents a significant step towards establishing a sustained human presence on the Moon and furthering deep space exploration.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Present Continuous for Future Plans</h3>
    <p>We often use the present continuous tense (subject + to be + verb-ing) to talk about fixed future arrangements or plans, especially when a time or date is mentioned or implied.</p>
    <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "Artemis III <span class="answer">is on track to land</span> humans on the Moon again, possibly by 2026."</p>
    <p class="example-sentence">Another example: "I <span class="answer">am meeting</span> my friends for dinner tomorrow." (A definite plan)</p>
    <p class="example-sentence">Compare with: "It <span class="answer">will rain</span> tomorrow." (A prediction, not a plan)</p>

    <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that form a new meaning. They are very common in spoken English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>gear up:</strong> (verb + adverb) to prepare for something.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "They're really <span class="answer">gearing up</span>!"</span></li>
        <li><strong>iron out:</strong> (verb + adverb) to resolve difficulties.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "They're still <span class="answer">ironing out</span> the kinks."</span></li>
        <li><strong>look forward to:</strong> (verb + adverb + preposition) to anticipate something with pleasure.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "I'm really <span class="answer">looking forward to</span> the trip."</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Idiomatic Expressions</h3>
    <p>Idioms are phrases or expressions whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary meanings of its words. They add color and naturalness to language.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>over the moon:</strong> extremely happy.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "I'm <span class="answer">over the moon</span> about it!"</span></li>
        <li><strong>get a kick out of something:</strong> to enjoy something a lot.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: "I knew you'd <span class="answer">get a kick out of</span> it."</span></li>
        <li><strong>no small feat:</strong> a significant achievement or difficult task.
