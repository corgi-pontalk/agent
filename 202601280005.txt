Alice : Oh, Bob! Fancy meeting you here! Are you actually in a _physical_ bookstore? I thought your natural habitat was somewhere with free Wi-Fi and unlimited coffee. Bob : Alice, good to see you! And yes, I'm just... researching. Gathering intelligence from the enemy's camp, if you will. I'm on the cusp of something big, you see. Alice : "Enemy's camp"? What on earth are you talking about? And "on the cusp of something big" usually means you've discovered a new flavor of instant ramen. Bob : Ha! Very funny. No, this is much grander. I'm finally taking the plunge and self-publishing my book! Alice : Your book? Wait, is this the philosophical treatise from your cat, Chairman Meow? I thought that was a joke! Bob : A joke? Alice, Chairman Meow's insights into the existential dread of a tuna-free diet are profound! And in the digital era, there are no more gatekeepers. I can upload it tonight! Alice : No gatekeepers... so no editors, no proofreaders, no actual human beings to say, "Bob, perhaps Chairman Meow's 'Ode to a Sunbeam' needs a stronger narrative arc"? Bob : Details, details! It's about raw, authentic voice! Plus, digital publishing is so much more accessible. My entire library fits in my pocket, and now Chairman Meow's wisdom can too! Alice : I guess that's convenient. But isn't the market completely saturated? There must be a million self-published cat memoirs out there. How will Chairman Meow stand out from the crowd? Bob : Ah, that's where my marketing genius comes in. Social media, cat influencer partnerships, maybe even a TikTok dance challenge featuring Chairman Meow himself! We're building a brand! Alice : So, you're telling me you've been spending weeks crafting hashtags instead of, you know, paragraphs? Bob : It's a holistic approach, Alice! Besides, traditional publishing is such a slow grind. Rejection after rejection, then years for it to hit the shelves. I want instant gratification! Alice : I suppose. But there's just something about holding a physical book, isn't there? The smell of the paper, the satisfying weight... Bob : Sentimental fluff! Give me a backlit screen and adjustable font size any day. Plus, my carbon pawprint is practically zero with e-books! Alice : "Carbon pawprint." Right. Well, good luck with Chairman Meow, Bob. I hope he goes viral for all the right reasons. Bob : He will! And when I'm a digital publishing mogul, I'll send you a free e-copy. Consider it a collector's item! Alice : Oh, joy. My digital shelf eagerly awaits.
