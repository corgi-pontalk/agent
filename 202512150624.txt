Alice: Hey Bob, have you thought much about the Winter Olympics in 2026? It feels like it's just around the corner!
Bob: Alice! You know me, I'm practically already polishing my imaginary bobsled! I hear Milan and Cortina are really gearing up for it.
Alice: Polishing your imaginary bobsled? Bob, the only thing you polish is the remote control on your couch! But yes, Milan-Cortina. I heard the preparations are in full swing.
Bob: Details, details. A man can dream, can't he? I'm just picturing myself nailing a triple axel... or maybe just gracefully falling into a snowdrift.
Alice: More likely the latter! I saw some news about the venues. Apparently, there are quite a few projects under construction , and they're really pushing for sustainability.
Bob: That's great to hear. I mean, we want epic games, but not at the expense of, you know, the actual winter. Imagine a Winter Olympics without snow!
Alice: Right? Though it's Italy, so maybe they'll just bring in a giant snow machine. The anticipation is building , especially for the opening ceremony.
Bob: Oh, I'm already picturing the spectacle. Do you think they'll manage to pull off something even more amazing than Beijing or PyeongChang?
Alice: They've got big shoes to fill, but Italians are known for their style, so I have high hopes. What sport are you most excited to watch?
Bob: Curling, definitely curling! It's like strategic sweeping on ice. I wouldn't mind trying it, actually. It looks less... impactful on the bones than, say, ski jumping.
Alice: True. I'm more into figure skating. All that grace and artistry. It makes me feel incredibly uncoordinated just watching it.
Bob: Tell me about it. My figure skating routine would mostly involve flailing and then landing on my bottom. But seriously, it's going to be a huge event for Italy.
Alice: Absolutely. And it's only two years away! I hope they manage to finish everything on time.
Bob: Me too. Let's start saving up for some authentic Italian hot chocolate to enjoy while we watch, eh?
Alice: Sounds like a plan, Bob! Just try not to break any imaginary bones before then.
Bob: No promises, Alice, no promises!
