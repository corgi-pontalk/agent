    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, you look like you're planning world domination. What's up?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! Not world domination, but maybe... business domination! I want to start my own company.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Wow! A company? You, a CEO? What kind of business? A dog walking empire?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Even better! I'm thinking... a gourmet banana stand. With tiny hats for the bananas.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Laughs) Tiny hats? That's certainly... unique. But entrepreneurship? That's a big step.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! I'm tired of working for others. I want to be my own boss. Make my own rules!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: And make your own money, right? That's the dream. But it's a lot of hard work. Long hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I know, I know. But imagine the freedom! No more boring meetings. Just me and my bananas.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: What about a business plan? Do you need capital? Investors?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Uh... a plan? I have a vision! And for capital, I have my piggy bank. Its name is Kevin.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Kevin the piggy bank might not be enough for a banana empire, Bob.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Details, details! The important thing is the idea. And the tiny hats.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You're really serious about this, aren't you?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Absolutely! Wish me luck. Maybe you can be my head of banana hat design?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Smiles) I'll consider it. Good luck, Bob! And don't forget the tiny umbrella for rainy days.</p>
