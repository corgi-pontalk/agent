    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob! You look… colorful today.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, hi Alice! Thanks! I thought this Hawaiian shirt was perfect for the rain. It brings the sun!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> The rain? Bob, it's sunny outside. And it's November.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Is it? Oh. Well, it's still good for making people smile! Look at these pink flamingos!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> They are… very visible. Are you going to a party?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> No, just to the supermarket. I need some milk.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You're going to buy milk in <em>that</em> shirt? And those bright green shorts?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Of course! Comfort is key. Plus, these shorts are new. My old jeans ripped yesterday.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ripped? Oh no! Was it a big rip?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, let's just say my cat thinks I needed more "ventilation" in the back.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Your <em>cat</em> ripped your jeans? How?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> He got stuck when I was trying to put them on. Long story. So, new shorts it is!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Maybe next time, buy pants <em>without</em> cat assistance. And maybe something in a darker color for the supermarket?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Nonsense! This is my "happy shopping" outfit! Want to come? You can wear something bright too!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> No thanks, Bob. I think I'll stick to my plain t-shirt and jeans today. Someone has to look normal.</p>

Online shopping for clothes is very popular, offering many choices.

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Adjectives for Describing Clothes</h3>
    <p>Adjectives tell us more about nouns (people, places, things). When we talk about clothes, we use adjectives to describe their color, condition, style, etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> colorful, bright, pink, green, darker</li>
        <li><strong>Condition:</strong> new, old, ripped</li>
        <li><strong>Style/Pattern:</strong> Hawaiian, plain</li>
        <li><strong>Feeling/Opinion:</strong> comfortable, visible, normal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adjectives usually come *before* the noun (e.g., "a <strong>Hawaiian</strong> shirt," "<strong>bright green</strong> shorts") or *after* the verb "to be" (e.g., "They <strong>are very visible</strong>," "Comfort <strong>is key</strong>," "You <strong>look colorful</strong>").</p>

    <h3>2. Present Simple vs. Present Continuous</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Simple (I wear, he wears):</strong> Used for habits, routines, facts, and general truths.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I usually <strong>wear</strong> jeans." (A habit)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Comfort <strong>is</strong> key." (A general truth)</p></li>
        <li><strong>Present Continuous (I am wearing, he is wearing):</strong> Used for actions happening *now*, at this moment, or temporary actions.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "What <strong>are</strong> you <strong>doing</strong>?" (Happening now)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "You're <strong>going</strong> to buy milk?" (Happening soon/planned)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I <strong>am wearing</strong> this shirt today." (Happening now/temporarily)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. The Verb "To Be" (am, is, are)</h3>
    <p>The verb "to be" is very common. We use it to describe things, identify people, talk about conditions, and more.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To describe:</strong> "It <strong>is</strong> sunny." "They <strong>are</strong> very visible."</li>
        <li><strong>With Present Continuous:</strong> "You <strong>are</strong> going." "I <strong>am</strong> looking."</li>
        <li><strong>With adjectives:</strong> "You <strong>are</strong> colorful." "These shorts <strong>are</strong> new."</li>
    </ul>
