Alice: Hey Bob, guess what? Big news!
Bob: What, Alice? Did you finally learn to juggle? Or win the lottery?
Alice: (Laughs) No, silly! Remember Sarah? Our friend from college? She's getting married!
Bob: Wow! Really? That's huge! Who's the lucky guy?
Alice: Mark! They've been together forever. I'm so excited for them!
Bob: Mark, huh? Good for them! I wonder if there will be a lot of dancing. My moves are legendary.
Alice: Of course there will be dancing! And a giant wedding cake! That's my absolute favorite part.
Bob: Cake is good. Very good. But the suits... do I have to wear a suit? They're so uncomfortable, like a fancy prison.
Alice: Bob, it's a wedding! You have to look nice. Maybe you'll even catch the bouquet!
Bob: The bouquet? Isn't that for the ladies? I'd much rather catch an extra slice of cake or a falling canap√©.
Alice: (Giggles) You're impossible! I'm already thinking about my dress.
Bob: Just don't wear a white one. That's for the bride! You don't want to confuse people.
Alice: I know that, Mr. Expert! Maybe a nice blue one, or a sparkly green.
Bob: Sounds good. As long as it's not a giant fluffy one that takes up two seats. I need my space for dancing.
Alice: Oh, you! It's going to be a beautiful wedding! And yes, there will be cake for you.
