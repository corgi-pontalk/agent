Alice : Hey, Bob, you look like you just discovered a new flavor of chips, or maybe found a twenty in an old jacket. What's got you so animated? Bob : Alice! Oh man, you wouldn't believe it! I was just reading about the early 2025 NFL preseason narratives, and my head is spinning! Alice : Preseason narratives? Already? It's barely past last season! What's got you so worked up? Bob : Well, for starters, Rookie QB Chad Thunderfoot is already being crowned MVP by some analysts! Can you believe the hype? Alice : Chad Thunderfoot? Sounds like a character from a cartoon. Are we sure he can throw a spiral, not just a lightning bolt? And "crowned MVP" before he's even played a snap? Bob : Exactly! And then there's the "Team X is finally breaking through" narrative. This year, it's the Jacksonville Jaguars. Stronger than ever, apparently! Alice : Didn't we hear that for the last five years about Team X, Y, and Z? At this point, "breaking through" means they'll win two more games than last season and maybe make a wild card push. Bob : Oh, don't forget the classic "veteran QB on a revenge tour" storyline! This time, it's old man Rivers, back from retirement for one last shot! Alice : Philip Rivers? From retirement? That's more of a "mobility scooter tour." And which veteran QB *isn't* on a revenge tour these days? They all have something to prove, usually to their last team's coaching staff. Bob : And the "coach on the hot seat" stories are already popping up! Apparently, Coach Grimshaw just breathed too heavily during a press conference, and now he's on the chopping block. Alice : Poor Grimshaw. Probably just needs a cough drop. But seriously, the offseason hype is always wild. It's almost more entertaining than the actual games sometimes. Bob : It IS the best part! Pure speculation, zero consequences! I'm already drafting my fantasy team based on these narratives! Alice : You're going to draft a fantasy team based on rumors about a guy named Chad Thunderfoot and Philip Rivers' "mobility scooter tour"? Good luck with that, Bob. Bob : It's not just rumors, Alice, it's *narratives*! They have gravitas! It's destiny! Alice : Destiny usually involves actual touchdowns, not just media soundbites. But I'll admit, it's fun to imagine the possibilities. Bob : Exactly! So, come on, who's your pick for the "surprise contender" narrative this year? Alice : Hmm, probably the team that actually invests in a decent offensive line, instead of just drafting another speedy receiver. Practicality over prophecy, I guess. Bob : You're no fun! But I guess you have a point. See you in September, when Chad Thunderfoot proves me right! Alice : We'll see, Bob. We'll see.
