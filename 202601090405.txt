Alice: Oh no, Bob! This is a disaster!
Bob: Alice, what's the problem? You look like you've seen a ghost... or maybe lost your chocolate.
Alice: Worse! I can't find my TV remote! My favorite show starts in five minutes!
Bob: Ah, the classic remote mystery. It's driving you crazy, huh?
Alice: Completely! I've looked everywhere.
Bob: Okay, let's think. Have you checked the sofa cushions? Remotes love sofa cushions.
Alice: Yes, first place! Not there.
Bob: Hmm. Maybe it's under the stack of magazines? Or behind the lamp?
Alice: Nope, looked there too. It's like it just vanished into thin air!
Bob: It could be in the kitchen. Sometimes I take mine with me when I get a snack.
Alice: The kitchen? But why? I wasn't even hungry. Oh wait... I _did_ get ice cream earlier.
Bob: What about the fridge? Or stuck to the bottom of your ice cream tub?
Alice: (Gasps) The fridge! Bob, you're a genius! (Sound of rummaging) YES! It's here! Next to the mustard!
Bob: Next to the mustard? That's a new one! So, that was the problem, a very cold remote.
Alice: Haha, yes! Thanks for your help, Bob! You saved my show!
