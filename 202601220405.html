    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what I did today?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, tell me! Did you finally conquer that giant crossword puzzle, or did you accidentally adopt another stray cat?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Neither! I tried to be super eco-friendly. I turned off all the lights... and then tripped over my own feet.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Classic Alice. Saving energy, one bruise at a time. I unplugged everything in my apartment this morning.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Wow! That's impressive. Even your toaster?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Especially my toaster! It's a notorious energy vampire. But then I couldn't make toast for breakfast.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: See? The struggle is real! I tried to take a cold shower to save on hot water.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And how did that go?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Let's just say I sounded like a startled otter. My neighbors probably think I'm being attacked.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Haha! I almost forgot to charge my phone. That uses a tiny bit of electricity even when it's just plugged in.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Right! Standby power. It's like a secret energy snack monster. My cat is probably less of an energy drain.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: My cat just sleeps. I think she's solar-powered during the day.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Maybe we should all be more like cats. Sleep, sunbathe, and demand food.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Sounds like a plan for world energy efficiency! Less human activity, more cat naps.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, mission 'save the planet' is going... creatively, for us.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Absolutely! We're practically pioneers of clumsy sustainability.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Energy and resources are very important for our daily lives. We use energy for almost everything: turning on lights, charging our phones, heating our homes, and driving cars. Most of this energy comes from "fossil fuels" like coal, oil, and natural gas. These resources are limited, which means they will not last forever. Also, burning fossil fuels pollutes our environment.</p>
    <p>That's why saving energy and finding "renewable resources" (like solar and wind power, which never run out) are so important. Even small actions, like turning off lights or unplugging chargers, can make a difference!</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>super eco-friendly</strong>: Very good for the environment.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>My sister is super eco-friendly; she rides her bike everywhere instead of driving.</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>energy vampire</strong>: An electronic device that uses electricity even when it's off or in standby mode.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>My old TV is an energy vampire; it uses a lot of power even when it's just plugged in.</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>the struggle is real</strong>: An informal phrase meaning something is difficult or challenging.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Learning a new language is hard, the struggle is real!</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>standby power</strong>: The electricity used by an appliance when it's turned off but still plugged in.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Did you know your phone charger uses standby power even when not charging your phone?</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>energy drain</strong>: Something that uses a lot of energy or makes you feel tired.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Having too many apps open on your phone is a huge energy drain for the battery.</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>solar-powered</strong>: Gets its energy from the sun.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>This calculator is solar-powered, so it doesn't need batteries.</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>turn off the lights</strong>: To switch off the electric lights.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Please turn off the lights when you leave the room to save electricity.</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>save on hot water</strong>: To use less hot water, often to reduce costs or energy use.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>I take shorter showers to save on hot water and energy.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Present Simple vs. Past Simple</h3>
    <p>We use the <strong>Present Simple</strong> for habits, routines, or facts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"My cat just <strong>sleeps</strong>."</span> (This is what the cat usually does.)</li>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"I <strong>turn off</strong> all the lights."</span> (This is a routine action.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use the <strong>Past Simple</strong> for actions that happened and finished at a specific time in the past.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"I <strong>tried</strong> to be super eco-friendly."</span> (This action happened earlier today.)</li>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"I <strong>unplugged</strong> everything in my apartment this morning."</span> (This action finished this morning.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Modals: Can/Could & Should</h3>
    <p><strong>Can / Can't (Could / Couldn't)</strong>: Expresses ability or possibility.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"I <strong>can't</strong> make toast."</span> (I don't have the ability right now.)</li>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"He <strong>couldn't</strong> speak English last year."</span> (He didn't have the ability in the past.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Should / Shouldn't</strong>: Expresses advice or recommendation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"Maybe we <strong>should</strong> all be more like cats."</span> (This is advice or a suggestion.)</li>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"You <strong>shouldn't</strong> waste water."</span> (This is a recommendation not to do something.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Common Question Forms (Did you...? How did that go?)</h3>
    <p>To ask about past actions, we often use <strong>"Did you...?"</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"<strong>Did you</strong> finally conquer that giant crossword puzzle?"</span></li>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"<strong>Did you</strong> turn off the TV?"</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To ask about the result or process of something, we can say <strong>"How did that go?"</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"I tried to cook a new recipe." "<strong>How did that go?</strong>"</span></li>
    </ul>
