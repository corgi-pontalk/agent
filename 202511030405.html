    <h2>Dialogue</h2>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, are we going the right way? This street looks new to me.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, don't worry! My Google Maps is *always* right. See? It says "continue straight for 200 meters."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: But the sign right there says "Dead End."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, that's just a suggestion, Alice. Google knows better. Let's go!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Sighs) Okay, Mr. Google Maps Expert. But if we end up in a pond, it's on you.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (A moment later) Hmm, it says "You have arrived at your destination." But... this is a park bench.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: A park bench? Bob, we're supposed to be at "Pizza Paradise"! Is this a new eco-friendly branch?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Uh, maybe Google Maps is testing my detective skills. It says "Pizza Paradise is 100 meters *to your left*."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Your left or *my* left? Because your left is usually my right.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (Checks phone) Oh, it means *my* left, which is *your* right. Wait, no. My left is my left!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Just point!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, it's that way! (Points in a completely different direction than before)</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, are you sure you typed in "Pizza Paradise" and not "Park Bench Paradise"?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (Eyes widen) Uh oh. My phone autocorrected it to "Pajama Paradise." That's a clothing store!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Buries face in hands) Bob, please just give me the phone. I'll type it in this time.</p>
