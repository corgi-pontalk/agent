    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Hey, Bob! Did you get an invitation for Tina's birthday party?</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, Alice! Yes, I did! It's next Saturday, right?</p>
        <p>Alice: That's the one! Are you going?</p>
        <p>Bob: Absolutely! Tina throws the best parties. You have to come!</p>
        <p>Alice: I wouldn't miss it! But I have a problem.</p>
        <p>Bob: What's up? Did you forget what to wear?</p>
        <p>Alice: No, silly! I can't think of a good gift. Any ideas?</p>
        <p>Bob: Hmm... Last year I got her a giant inflatable flamingo. It was a hit!</p>
        <p>Alice: A flamingo? That's... unique. Maybe something a bit more practical this year?</p>
        <p>Bob: Practical? For Tina? She loves silly things! How about a really fluffy monster-shaped hat?</p>
        <p>Alice: (Laughing) Bob, you're impossible! She already has three. I was thinking of a nice book or some fancy tea.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, a book! That's actually a good idea. Or, we could bake her a cake together!</p>
        <p>Alice: That sounds fun! But I'm terrible at baking. My cakes always look like lopsided volcanoes.</p>
        <p>Bob: No worries! I'm a baking genius! We can make a chocolate lava cake! It'll be delicious, even if it looks like a volcano.</p>
        <p>Alice: (Smiling) Okay, Bob, you're on! A joint volcano cake it is!</p>
        <p>Bob: Perfect! See you at the party, Alice!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Talking About Future Plans: "To be" + verb-ing</h3>
    <p>We often use the present continuous tense (form of "to be" + verb-ing) to talk about future plans, especially when they are already arranged.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Are you going?</span> (Asking about a future plan)</li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">I am going</span> to the party next Saturday.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is common for social events, travel, and appointments.</p>
    <h3>2. "Can" and "Can't" for Ability</h3>
    <p>"Can" means you have the ability to do something, while "can't" (cannot) means you don't.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">I can't think</span> of a good gift. (I don't have the ability to think of one right now.)</li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">We can make</span> a chocolate lava cake! (We have the ability to make one.)</li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">I can bake</span> a cake. (I have the skill.)</li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">I can't bake</span> a cake. (I don't have the skill.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Asking Simple Questions (Yes/No and Wh-questions)</h3>
    <p>To ask questions, we often change the word order or use question words.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes/No Questions:</strong> Start with "Did", "Are", "Is", "Do", etc.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Did you get</span> an invitation? (Answer: Yes, I did / No, I didn't)</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Are you going?</span> (Answer: Yes, I am / No, I'm not)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wh-questions:</strong> Start with "What", "Where", "Who", "When", "Why", "How".
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">What's up?</span> (Asking for information about a situation)</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Any ideas?</span> (A short way to ask "Do you have any ideas?")</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
