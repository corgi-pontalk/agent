    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Alice, you won't believe what I just read about 'The International' prize pool!</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</strong>: 'The International'? Is that like the Olympics, but for... finger dexterity?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Haha, close! It's the biggest Dota 2 tournament, and this year, the prize pool hit like $40 million. Forty! Million! Dollars!</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</strong>: Wait, people earn that much from playing video games? My mom always told me gaming was a waste of time!</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Tell her the <span class="key-phrase">esports arena</span> is the new corporate boardroom! These pros train like Olympic athletes. Their reaction times are insane.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</strong>: So, they're basically rockstar nerds? Are there stadiums full of screaming fans for this?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Absolutely! Packed arenas, massive screens, commentators, dazzling light shows. It's a full-blown spectacle. A <span class="key-phrase">global phenomenon</span> doesn't even begin to cover it.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</strong>: Wow, I thought it was just people yelling into headsets in their basements. Is it truly global?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Totally global! Teams from Korea, Europe, China, North America... The <span class="key-phrase">competitive gaming scene</span> is worldwide. There are even <span class="key-phrase">pro gaming leagues</span> with regular seasons.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</strong>: So, which games are the big ones? Is it all shooting games, or are there strategy ones too?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Oh, it's a huge <span class="key-phrase">variety of titles</span>. Dota 2, League of Legends, CS:GO, Valorant, Overwatch, even fighting games like Street Fighter. Strategy, shooters, MOBAs – you name it.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</strong>: I tried League of Legends once. My <span class="key-phrase">kill-death ratio</span> was so bad, I think I actually owed the enemy team kills.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Haha, it takes practice! But seriously, <span class="key-phrase">esports viewership</span> rivals traditional sports now. Brands are pouring money into it.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</strong>: So, if I start practicing my Mario Kart skills now, do you think I could be a millionaire by next year? Or maybe just a <span class="key-phrase">competitive amateur</span>?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</strong>: Dream big, Alice! But maybe start with a less chaotic game first. The <span class="key-phrase">path to pro</span> is long, but who knows? We could be watching *you* in a <span class="key-phrase">global arena</span> someday!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>eSports, or electronic sports, refers to organized competitive video gaming. What was once a niche hobby has exploded into a multi-billion dollar industry and a significant part of global entertainment. Professional players compete individually or in teams for massive prize pools, often in front of live audiences filling dedicated <span class="key-phrase">esports arenas</span> and millions more watching online via streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube.</p>

Major events like <span class="key-phrase">'The International'</span> (Dota 2) and the League of Legends World Championship attract <span class="key-phrase">esports viewership</span> numbers comparable to traditional sporting events. This <span class="key-phrase">global phenomenon</span> has led to the establishment of <span class="key-phrase">pro gaming leagues</span>, sponsorships from major brands, and a structured <span class="key-phrase">path to pro</span> for aspiring gamers worldwide. It's truly a <span class="key-phrase">global arena</span> where skill, strategy, and rapid reflexes are celebrated.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. The Present Simple for Facts and General Truths</h3>
    <p>The Present Simple tense is frequently used when discussing eSports (or any topic) to state facts, describe habits, or express general truths that are always true or true for a long period.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + Verb (base form or verb + -s/-es for third person singular)</li>
        <li><strong>Examples from the dialogue and current situation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"It <span class="highlight">is</span> the biggest Dota 2 tournament." (Fact)</li>
                <li>"These pros <span class="highlight">train</span> like Olympic athletes." (General truth/habit)</li>
                <li>"The competitive gaming scene <span class="highlight">is</span> worldwide." (Fact)</li>
                <li>"eSports <span class="highlight">features</span> a variety of titles." (Fact)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Why it's useful here:</strong> It allows us to clearly state established facts and characteristics of the eSports world without implying a temporary action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Comparatives and Superlatives for Comparisons</h3>
    <p>We use comparatives and superlatives to compare two or more things, often to express opinions or highlight differences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparatives (comparing two things):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Adjective/Adverb + -er (for short words) OR More + Adjective/Adverb (for longer words). Followed by "than".</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"...maybe start with a <span class="highlight">less chaotic</span> game first." (Comparing one game type to another)</li>
                        <li>"Esports is becoming <span class="highlight">more popular than</span> some traditional sports among younger audiences." (Comparing esports popularity to traditional sports)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Superlatives (comparing three or more things, or the ultimate degree):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> The + Adjective/Adverb + -est (for short words) OR The most + Adjective/Adverb (for longer words).</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"It's <span class="highlight">the biggest</span> Dota 2 tournament..." (Comparing to all other Dota 2 tournaments)</li>
                        <li>"Dota 2 has <span class="highlight">the largest</span> prize pool in esports." (Comparing to all other esports games)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Why it's useful here:</strong> To emphasize the scale and impact of eSports by comparing it to other phenomena or within the gaming world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Idioms and Figurative Language</h3>
    <p>Idioms are phrases where the meaning isn't obvious from the individual words. Figurative language uses words in a non-literal way to create a vivid image or convey a specific feeling. They add color and humor to conversations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"<span class="highlight">Waste of time</span>": An activity that doesn't produce anything useful or worthwhile.
                    <p><em>Example:</em> "My mom always told me gaming was a <span class="highlight">waste of time</span>!"</p></li>
                <li>"<span class="highlight">Rockstar nerds</span>": A humorous, informal phrase to describe incredibly skilled and celebrated individuals in a typically 'nerdy' field (like gaming), who achieve fame similar to rock stars.
                    <p><em>Example:</em> "So, they're basically <span class="highlight">rockstar nerds</span>?"</p></li>
                <li>"<span class="highlight">Doesn't even begin to cover it</span>": An expression meaning that a description or statement is insufficient to fully convey the scale or importance of something.
                    <p><em>Example:</em> "A 'global phenomenon' <span class="highlight">doesn't even begin to cover it</span>."</p></li>
                <li>"<span class="highlight">You name it</span>": An expression used to say that you can include many other similar things in a list, often implying a wide variety.
                    <p><em>Example:</em> "Strategy, shooters, MOBAs – <span class="highlight">you name it</span>."</p></li>
                <li>"<span class="highlight">Dream big</span>": An encouragement to have ambitious goals.
                    <p><em>Example:</em> "<span class="highlight">Dream big</span>, Alice! You never know what you can achieve."</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Why it's useful here:</strong> These expressions make the dialogue more natural, humorous, and relatable, reflecting how native speakers often communicate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercise 4: Comprehension & Discussion</h3>
    <p>Answer the following questions based on the dialogue and your understanding of the topic. (No single "right" answer for discussion questions; focus on using learned vocabulary and grammar.)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>According to Bob, why is gaming no longer just a "waste of time"?</li>
        <li>What aspects of a live esports event make it a "full-blown spectacle" for Bob?</li>
        <li>Do you think esports will ever fully surpass traditional sports in popularity? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>If you were to try to become a "competitive amateur," which type of game would you choose and why?</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="exercise-answer">
        <strong>Answers to Exercise 4 (Sample Answers):</strong><br>
        1. According to Bob, gaming is no longer just a "waste of time" because professional players can earn millions in prize pools, train like Olympic athletes, and the esports industry is a significant global phenomenon with major brand investment. He humorously states the "esports arena" is the new corporate boardroom.<br>
        2. For Bob, a live esports event is a "full-blown spectacle" due to packed arenas, massive screens, energetic commentators, and dazzling light shows, creating an atmosphere akin to a traditional sports event or a concert.<br>
        3. (<em>Student's own opinion, using learned vocabulary/grammar.</em> Example: "I believe esports has the potential to become <strong>more popular than</strong> some traditional sports, especially among younger generations, because of its digital accessibility and the <strong>variety of titles</strong>. However, traditional sports have a longer history and cultural roots, so completely surpassing them might be a very long <strong>path to pro</strong> for esports.")<br>
        4. (<em>Student's own opinion, using learned vocabulary/grammar.</em> Example: "If I were to become a <strong>competitive amateur</strong>, I would choose a strategy game like 'StarCraft II' because it seems <strong>less chaotic</strong> than a fast-paced shooter, and I enjoy thinking through complex decisions rather than relying solely on rapid reflexes. It might have a challenging <strong>path to pro</strong>, but the intellectual challenge appeals to me.")
