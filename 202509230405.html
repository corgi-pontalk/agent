    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, this new restaurant looks amazing! I'm so excited to try it.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, I'm absolutely starving! My stomach is making strange noises.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha! Well, let's find a table. Oh, this one looks good by the window.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perfect! So, what are you in the mood for? I could eat a horse.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A horse? Wow, you <em>are</em> hungry! I think I'll have the pasta. It sounds delicious.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Pasta? Hmm, I saw a giant burger on the menu. That’s my kind of food!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Of course it is, Bob. You always go for the biggest thing!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It's called "The Everest Burger"! How can I resist?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good luck climbing that mountain! I’ll just have a small salad to start, then the pasta.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Salad? Are you sure you're at the right place? This isn't a rabbit cafe!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: It's a nice start! Maybe I’ll share a fry or two from your Everest.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Only if you promise not to tell anyone I shared my fries. It’s a secret mission.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Deal! Oh, here comes the waiter. Are you ready to order, Captain Everest?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Ready as I'll ever be! I'm going to conquer that burger.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good luck, Bob! I hope it's as good as it sounds.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>I am</strong>: Used with the pronoun "I".

            <br><em>Example:</em> "This restaurant <strong>is</strong> new." "The burger <strong>is</strong> giant."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Present Simple Tense</h3>
    <p>We use the present simple tense for actions that are habits, routines, facts, or general truths.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject + Base Form of Verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it)</strong></li>

            <ul>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Ordering Food: "I'll have..."</h3>
    <p>When you are in a restaurant and want to tell the waiter what you want to eat or drink, "I'll have..." is a very common and polite way. It's a contraction of "I will have...".</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I think <strong>I'll have</strong> the pasta."</li>
        <li><em>Other examples:</em> "<strong>I'll have</strong> a glass of water, please." "For my main course, <strong>I'll have</strong> the fish."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Asking Questions with "What"</h3>
    <p>"What" is a question word used to ask for specific information about things or actions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>What</strong> are you in the mood for?" (Asking about Bob's food preference)</li>
        <li><em>Other examples:</em> "<strong>What</strong> is your name?" "<strong>What</strong> time is it?" "<strong>What</strong> do you like to do?"</li>
