    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, hi Bob! You look surprised to see me here.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Wow, you look like you just ran a marathon, or maybe you're planning one? What's up?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ha! Even better. I'm planning my dream trip abroad!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: A trip abroad? That sounds fancy! Where are you going? To Mars?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Not Mars, silly! I'm thinking... Italy! Imagine, pizza, pasta, ancient ruins!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Italy! Wow! Are you rich now? Or did you win the lottery?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Nope, just saving every penny! And I found some super cheap flight tickets! It's my big adventure.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Cheap flights to Italy? That sounds suspicious. Did you check the airplane's age? Is it made of cardboard?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Very funny! It's a reputable airline! And I'm just going with a backpack. No fancy suitcases for me.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: A backpack? So you're packing your whole house in there? Don't forget your toothbrush! And your passport!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Of course! Passport, tickets, toothbrush, and my lucky travel gnome! He needs to see the world.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: A travel gnome? Okay, that's new. Are you going to eat a lot of gelato?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Absolutely! Gelato for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! And maybe learn some Italian. "Ciao!"</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: "Ciao!" Be careful not to get lost. What if you try to order a pizza and accidentally order a hat?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Laughing) I'll try my best! I have a translation app! Wish me luck!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Good luck, Alice! Bring me back some Italian snacks, okay? No gnomes.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Deal! Maybe a mini gnome for you, Bob! Just kidding! See you when I get back!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Traveling abroad is becoming easier and more popular today! Many people dream of visiting new countries to see famous places, try delicious food, and learn about different cultures. To travel internationally, you usually need a passport, and sometimes a visa, which is a special permit from the country you want to visit. Some people travel with a big suitcase, and some, like Alice, prefer a small backpack to save money and travel light. It's an exciting way to see the world and make new memories!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Continuous for Future Plans</h3>
    <p>We often use the <strong>present continuous tense</strong> (subject + am/is/are + verb-ing) to talk about plans or arrangements for the future, especially when they are already decided or scheduled.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>I'm planning</strong> my dream trip abroad. (This plan is already in progress or decided.)</li>
        <li><strong>Where are you going?</strong> (Asking about a future travel destination that is likely planned.)</li>
        <li><strong>I'm just going</strong> with a backpack. (Describes a planned method of travel.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    I <strong>am meeting</strong> my friend for dinner tonight. (The meeting is planned.)<br>
    She <strong>is visiting</strong> her grandparents next weekend. (The visit is arranged.)</p>

    <h3>2. Imperatives (Commands and Instructions)</h3>
    <p><strong>Imperatives</strong> are used to give commands, instructions, or make requests. For positive commands, we use the base form of the verb. For negative commands, we use "Don't" + base verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't forget</strong> your toothbrush! (Negative command/reminder)</li>
        <li><strong>Be careful</strong> not to get lost. (Positive command/advice)</li>
        <li><strong>Bring me back</strong> some Italian snacks. (Positive request)</li>
        <li><strong>Imagine</strong>, pizza, pasta, ancient ruins! (Positive invitation to think)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    <strong>Close</strong> the door.<br>
    <strong>Don't touch</strong> that.<br>
    <strong>Please sit down</strong>.</p>

    <h3>3. Basic Question Words (Who, What, Where)</h3>
    <p>These words help us ask for specific information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What</strong>: Asks about things or actions.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What's up?</strong> (What is happening?)</li>
                <li><strong>What if</strong> you try to order a pizza and accidentally order a hat? (Asking about a possible scenario)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Where</strong>: Asks about a place or location.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Where are you going?</strong> (Asking about the destination)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    <strong>What</strong> is your name?<br>
    <strong>Where</strong> do you live?</p>
