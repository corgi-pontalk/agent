    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, guess what I just saw? Mind-blowing!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, spill the beans! Did you finally try that VR history lesson?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Even better! A demo of a VR biology lab. I almost dissected a virtual frog. No actual frog guts, thank goodness!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Whoa! Seriously? That sounds way more fun than my actual biology classes.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! And the professor was a hologram. He looked suspiciously like my old chemistry teacher, but with better hair.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Imagine geography lessons. Instead of staring at a map, you're *standing* on Mount Everest, feeling the wind!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Or diving with great white sharks for marine biology without the actual shark *encounter*. Sign me up for that!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: My only concern: what if I get so immersed I forget where I am and try to high-five a virtual dinosaur?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Been there, done that, virtually speaking. I almost ordered a virtual latte from a virtual cafe in my virtual Roman Empire tour.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: See? The possibilities are endless! No more boring textbooks. It could truly revolutionize learning.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: But what about actual human interaction? You can't ask a VR teacher for extra credit.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: True, but you could probably get a virtual pat on the back. And think of field trips! No permission slips, no bus fees.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: My inner procrastinator is already envisioning 'accidentally' falling into a black hole during a physics lesson to avoid a pop quiz.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: That's thinking outside the headset, Alice! But seriously, the educational potential is enormous.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I guess so. As long as I don't get stuck in a virtual loop of Pythagoras theorem.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being recognized as a powerful tool in education, transforming traditional learning environments into interactive and immersive experiences. Schools and universities globally are beginning to pilot VR programs, allowing students to explore historical sites, conduct scientific experiments, or even practice complex surgical procedures in a safe, virtual setting. This technology enhances engagement, improves comprehension through experiential learning, and can make abstract concepts more tangible.</p>
    <p>However, the widespread adoption of VR in education still faces hurdles. These include the high cost of VR headsets and equipment, the need for specialized content development, and ensuring equitable access for all students. There are also considerations regarding potential motion sickness, screen time, and the balance between virtual and in-person interaction. Despite these challenges, ongoing advancements in VR technology and content creation suggest a future where VR plays a significant role in making education more dynamic, accessible, and engaging for learners of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 - Real Conditional)</h3>
        <p>Type 1 conditionals are used to talk about real and possible situations in the future. They describe situations that are likely to happen under certain conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <code>If + Present Simple, will/can/may + Base Verb</code></p>
        <p><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"<strong>what if I get</strong> so immersed <strong>I forget</strong> where I am...?" (<code>If I get..., I forget...</code> - future consequence)</li>
            <li>"As long as <strong>I don't get stuck</strong> in a virtual loop..." (<code>If I don't get stuck...</code> - condition for something to be acceptable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>More examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If it rains tomorrow, we will stay home.</li>
            <li>If you study hard, you can pass the exam.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning. Their meaning is often idiomatic and cannot be guessed from the individual words.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spill the beans</strong>: to reveal a secret or information.
                <br/><em>"Alice, <strong>spill the beans</strong>! Did you finally try that VR history lesson?"</em></li>
            <li><strong>Sign me up</strong>: to express desire to join or participate in an activity.
                <br/><em>"Or diving with great white sharks... <strong>Sign me up</strong> for that!"</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>More examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look up (search for information): I need to look up that word in the dictionary.</li>
            <li>Give up (stop trying): Don't give up on your dreams.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Gerunds vs. Infinitives</h3>
        <p><strong>Gerunds</strong> are verbs ending in -ing that function as nouns. They can be subjects, objects, or follow prepositions.</p>
        <p><strong>Infinitives</strong> are the base form of a verb, usually preceded by "to" (e.g., to run, to eat). They can also function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gerund as object/after preposition:</strong> "Instead of <strong>staring</strong> at a map, you're <strong>standing</strong> on Mount Everest!"</li>
            <li><strong>Gerund as object:</strong> "Or <strong>diving</strong> with great white sharks..."</li>
            <li><strong>Infinitive of purpose:</strong> "...to avoid a pop quiz." (<code>to avoid</code> explains the reason why)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>More examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gerund:</strong> <strong>Reading</strong> is my favorite hobby. (subject) / I enjoy <strong>swimming</strong>. (object) / She's good at <strong>listening</strong>. (after preposition)</li>
            <li><strong>Infinitive:</strong> I want <strong>to learn</strong> Spanish. (object) / He came <strong>to see</strong> me. (infinitive of purpose)</li>
        </ul>
