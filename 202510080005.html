    <h1>Dialogue</h1>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Hey Bob, have you seen the news about that amazing space mission?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! You mean the one ESA is sending to Jupiter? The 'JUICE' mission?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly! What a name, right? It sounds like they're sending a giant smoothie maker to space.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Haha, totally! I keep picturing a space-themed juice box. But seriously, do you know what JUICE actually stands for?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> I do! It's the JUpiter ICy moons Explorer. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> JUpiter ICy moons Explorer... Whoa, icy moons? So, like, giant space popsicles?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly, but way more scientific! They're looking for oceans of liquid water under all that ice on moons like Europa and Ganymede.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oceans... under ice? Wait, so there could be actual space fish? Or maybe, like, alien ice cream cones?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, focus! The point is, where there's liquid water, there's potential for life. It's a huge step in our search for extraterrestrial existence!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Okay, okay, no alien ice cream. But how long does it even take to get to Jupiter? It's not exactly next door.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> That's the crazy part! It launched last year, but it won't actually arrive at Jupiter until 2031.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> 2031?! I'll be practically ancient by then! We'll probably have flying cars and robot maids before JUICE even gets there.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> True, it takes ages, but imagine the data they'll send back. It'll be worth the wait to understand these mysterious moons.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> I guess. Do you think they'll send back selfies from Ganymede? "Look, Mom, no hands!"</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> (Laughs) I highly doubt it, Bob. It's packed with scientific instruments, not a selfie stick. Magnetometers, spectrometers, radar...</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Fine, no selfies. But still, it's pretty mind-blowing. Imagine being the first to find something truly alien!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Absolutely! It’s a massive undertaking and a huge step for humanity, even if we have to be patient.</p>

    <h1>Current Situation</h1>
    <p>
        The European Space Agency (ESA) launched its JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) mission in April 2023. This ambitious mission is designed to spend at least three years making detailed observations of Jupiter and its three large ocean-bearing moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. The primary goal is to investigate whether these icy moons harbor liquid water oceans beneath their surfaces, which could potentially support life. JUICE will specifically enter orbit around Ganymede, making it the first spacecraft to orbit an outer planet's moon. After a long journey, JUICE is expected to arrive in the Jovian system in July 2031. The data collected will provide crucial insights into the potential for habitable environments in our solar system beyond Earth.
