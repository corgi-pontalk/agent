    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, Bob! You actually came! I thought you'd be late as usual.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice, of course I came! Who else would wave you off with such dramatic flair? Is this the right gate?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Gate B12. Yes, this is it. My flight to Hawaii is boarding soon. I'm so excited!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Hawaii! Wow! Don't forget to send me a postcard of a surfing pineapple.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> I'll try, but I think the airport security might confiscate it if it's too spiky.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Speaking of security, did you remember to take out your liquids? And your shoes? And your dignity?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> (rolls her eyes) Yes, Bob. My dignity is safely tucked away in my carry-on.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Good. And your passport? Your ticket? Your sense of adventure?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> All present and accounted for, Captain Worry-Wart.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Just making sure! Last time, you almost left your pet goldfish in the overhead locker.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> That was a dream, Bob, and I don't even <em>have</em> a goldfish!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Details, details. Anyway, have an amazing trip! Don't talk to strangers... unless they offer you free snacks.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> (laughs) Thanks, Bob. I'll miss your terrible advice.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> You know you love it! Text me when you land, okay?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> I will! You go home and get some sleep. You look like you just wrestled a bear.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Maybe I did! Safe travels, Alice! See you when you get back!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bye, Bob! Thanks for everything!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Alice and Bob are at the airport. Alice is about to fly to Hawaii, and Bob is there to see her off. They are good friends, so their conversation is casual, friendly, and full of playful jokes. Bob is a bit of a worrier, comically checking on Alice's preparations, while Alice takes it all in stride.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <p>Here are a few grammar points used in the dialogue that are useful for beginners:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="grammar-point">Present Continuous for Future Plans</span></p>
            <p>We often use the Present Continuous tense (<strong>is/am/are + verb-ing</strong>) to talk about future arrangements or plans that are already decided. This is very common for travel plans.</p>
            <p>Example from dialogue: "My flight to Hawaii <span class="grammar-point">is boarding soon</span>." (The boarding is a scheduled event in the near future.)</p>
            <p>Other examples: "I <span class="grammar-point">am meeting</span> my friend tomorrow." "They <span class="grammar-point">are flying</span> to London next week."</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="grammar-point">Imperatives</span></p>
            <p>Imperatives are used to give commands, instructions, or advice. They use the base form of the verb, without a subject.</p>
            <p>Example from dialogue: "<span class="grammar-point">Don't forget</span> to send me a postcard." "<span class="grammar-point">Text me</span> when you land." "<span class="grammar-point">Go</span> home and get some sleep."</p>
            <p>To make them negative, we add "Don't" before the verb: "<span class="grammar-point">Don't talk</span> to strangers."</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="grammar-point">Prepositions of Place (at, in, to)</span></p>
            <p>These small words tell us about the location or direction of something.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>At</strong>: Used for a general location or a specific point.
                    <p>Example: "We are <span class="grammar-point">at</span> the airport." "She is <span class="grammar-point">at</span> Gate B12."</p></li>
                <li><strong>In</strong>: Used for an enclosed space or a larger area.
                    <p>Example: "My dignity is <span class="grammar-point">in</span> my carry-on." "You can put your bag <span class="grammar-point">in</span> the overhead locker."</p></li>
                <li><strong>To</strong>: Used to show movement towards a destination.
                    <p>Example: "My flight <span class="grammar-point">to</span> Hawaii." "I'm flying <span class="grammar-point">to</span> London."</p></li>
            </ul></li>
    </ul>
