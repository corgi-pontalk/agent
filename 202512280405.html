        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hey Alice! You won't believe what I just saw.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, hi Bob! What's got you so excited? A flying squirrel?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Even better! A new ice cream shop opened. They have pickle-flavored ice cream!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Pickle?! You're kidding! My curiosity is piqued.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, I was thinking... <strong>Are you free this weekend</strong> to try it? For scientific research, of course.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hmm, 'scientific research' with ice cream? Sounds like my kind of lab work! Let me check my calendar. Saturday afternoon looks good. <strong>What about you?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Saturday afternoon? Perfect! I'm free all day.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Great! So, <strong>how about 2 PM on Saturday?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: 2 PM, Saturday. Got it. Do you know where the place is?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: It's called 'Crazy Cones' on Elm Street. We can <strong>meet there</strong>, or I can pick you up.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: 'Crazy Cones'! Sounds appropriate. I can meet you there. Saves you a trip.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Okay, so meet at Crazy Cones, Saturday at 2 PM. <strong>Just to confirm.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Confirmed! I'll wear my bravest taste buds.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Wonderful! I'm actually a bit scared but also excited. What if it's actually delicious?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Then we've discovered a new culinary frontier, Alice! Or a new way to prank our friends. Maybe bring some water... just in case.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Ha! Smart thinking! I'll come prepared. My taste buds are ready for battle.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Excellent! May the best flavor win! See ya, Alice!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: See you, Bob!</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <h3>1. Prepositions of Time and Place</h3>
            <p>We use specific prepositions to talk about time and place when making appointments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On</strong>: Used for specific days of the week or dates.
                    <span class="example-sentence"><em>Meet me <strong>on</strong> Saturday. My birthday is <strong>on</strong> August 15th.</em></span></li>
                <li><strong>At</strong>: Used for specific times.
                    <span class="example-sentence"><em>Let's meet <strong>at</strong> 2 PM. The class starts <strong>at</strong> 9 o'clock.</em></span></li>
                <li><strong>In</strong>: Used for months, seasons, years, or general parts of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, but not 'night').
                    <span class="example-sentence"><em>We'll go <strong>in</strong> July. I'll see you <strong>in</strong> the afternoon.</em></span></li>
                <li><strong>At</strong>: Used for specific locations or addresses.
                    <span class="example-sentence"><em>Meet me <strong>at</strong> the park. We are meeting <strong>at</strong> Crazy Cones.</em></span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Simple Present for Future Arrangements</h3>
            <p>When you have a fixed plan or appointment, especially something scheduled, you can use the simple present tense to talk about future events. This makes the plan sound definite.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="example-sentence"><em>We <strong>meet</strong> at Crazy Cones on Saturday.</em></span> (Instead of "We will meet...")</li>
                <li><span class="example-sentence"><em>The train <strong>leaves</strong> at 6 PM.</em></span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Modal Verbs for Suggestions and Availability</h3>
            <p>Modal verbs like "can" and "should" are very useful for making suggestions, asking about availability, and expressing possibility or inability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Can</strong>: Used to ask about ability or possibility, also to suggest.
                    <span class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Can</strong> you meet on Friday? I <strong>can</strong> come at 5 PM.</em></span></li>
                <li><strong>Can't / Cannot</strong>: Expresses inability or unavailability.
                    <span class="example-sentence"><em>I <strong>can't</strong> meet tomorrow. I <strong>cannot</strong> make it to the party.</em></span></li>
                <li><strong>Should</strong>: Used to ask for or give advice, or to suggest something gently.
                    <span class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Should</strong> we meet earlier? (Suggestion)</em></span></li>
            </ul>
