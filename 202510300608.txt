Bob : Alice, you won't believe what happened this morning! Alice : Oh, Bob, let me guess. Did your shower suddenly turn into a single, sorrowful tear? Bob : Worse! My landlord *put up* a notice about *conserving water*. I barely managed to rinse my toothbrush! Alice : *Tell me about it*! I almost had to dry-clean my face. It's like we're living in a desert oasis... without the oasis. Bob : Right? I was just thinking, is this just *our* building, or is the whole city turning into a giant sand dune? Alice : Nah, it's bigger than that, Bob. I was reading an article about *global water scarcity* last night. It's a real *challenge*. Bob : Global? So it's not just my landlord being cheap? Phew. But wait, that's actually worse. Alice : Exactly! *Potable water* is becoming a *precious resource* in so many places. It's not just about *turning off* the tap while brushing. Bob : So, no more hour-long, contemplative showers, even on weekends? My dreams are *shattering*. Alice : Pretty much! *Water stress* affects billions. Think about agriculture, sanitation... Bob : Agriculture? Does that mean my beloved avocado toast is in danger? This is getting serious. Alice : Possibly! And it's driven by *climate change*, population growth, even *pollution*. Bob : Wow. I always thought water was just... *there*. Like air, but wetter. Alice : Not always, not everywhere. We really *need* better *water management* strategies, and individuals *should* do their part too. Bob : So, maybe I *should* start collecting rainwater for my morning coffee? Just in case. Alice : Might not be a bad idea, Bob, might not be a bad idea.
