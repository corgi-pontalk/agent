Alice : Hey Bob, what are you doing this Saturday? Bob : Oh, Alice! Just planning to... maybe watch paint dry? Why? Alice : Ha! How about something more exciting? Like, visiting a museum? Bob : A museum? Really? I thought we were friends! Alice : We are! And friends explore! Think of the history, the art, the... air conditioning! Bob : Air conditioning is a strong point. But which one? Not another ancient pottery museum, please. My eyes can only handle so much brown. Alice : Don't worry, art critic! How about the Museum of Quirky Inventions? I heard they have a machine that toasts bread and plays the banjo. Bob : Now _that_ sounds like my kind of history! Is it real? Or just a very artistic toaster? Alice : Only one way to find out! And they have a gift shop with astronaut ice cream. Bob : Astronaut ice cream! You had me at banjo-playing toaster, but now I'm practically running there. What time? Alice : Let's meet at 10 AM. Early bird gets the worm... or the first bite of space food. Bob : Sounds like a plan, Alice! I'll even try to look intellectual. Maybe I'll wear my glasses. Alice : Good idea, Bob. Just remember not to touch anything. Especially not the banjo toaster. Bob : No promises! What if it's lonely and needs a hug? Kidding! (Mostly.) Alice : See you Saturday! Get ready for an adventure. Bob : Can't wait! Banjo-toaster, here I come!
