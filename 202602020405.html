    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, what's up? You look like you're plotting something big!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, hi Alice! Just thinking about my next big <strong>startup idea</strong>. I want to be a successful <strong>founder</strong>!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh really? Another one? Is this the "app that orders pizza for your cat" idea again?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Haha, no! This time it's serious. It's an app for finding lost socks. Imagine, no more single socks!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Laughs) That's... certainly an <strong>idea</strong>! How will it work?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, users upload a picture of their lonely sock. The app uses AI to match it with its missing partner. I need to build a <strong>prototype</strong> first.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Interesting. And who would <strong>invest</strong> in that? You'd need a lot of <strong>funding</strong> to make it happen.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: That's where my "<strong>pitch</strong>" comes in! I'll tell potential <strong>investors</strong> it's about solving a global laundry crisis. Think of the emotional toll of mismatched socks!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You always have such a unique perspective. But seriously, getting <strong>seed funding</strong> can be tough.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I know, I know. But if I can build a working <strong>prototype</strong>, I can show them it's possible. Maybe I'll start with just white socks. Keep it simple!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good strategy! Small steps. So, what's the company name for "The Sock Finder"?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I'm thinking... "Sock-It-To-Me!" Or maybe "SoleMate." What do you think?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: "SoleMate" has potential! Just make sure your <strong>startup</strong> has a clear plan, not just a catchy name.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: You're right. First, the <strong>prototype</strong>. Then, I'll practice my <strong>pitch</strong>. Wish me luck!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good luck, Bob! Let me know when you're rich and can buy me a lifetime supply of matched socks!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h3>1. Simple Present Tense for Routines and Facts</h3>
        We use the simple present tense to talk about habits, routines, general truths, and facts.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject + Verb (base form or -s/-es for he/she/it)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <em>Examples from dialogue:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>"You <strong>look</strong> like you're plotting something big!" (a current observation, a fact)</li>
            <li>"How <strong>will</strong> it <strong>work</strong>?" (asking about a general process)</li>
            <li>"The app <strong>uses</strong> AI..." (a fact about the app)</li>
            <li>"You always <strong>have</strong> such a unique perspective." (a habit/characteristic of Alice)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> For he/she/it, we add -s or -es to the verb (e.g., he walks, she likes, it goes). For I/you/we/they, the verb stays in its base form (e.g., I walk, you like, we go).</p>

        <h3>2. Modals for Possibility and Need: "Can" and "Need To"</h3>
        <strong>Can:</strong> Used to express ability or possibility.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject + can + base verb</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <em>Examples from dialogue:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>"Who would <strong>invest</strong> in that? You'd need a lot of funding to make it <strong>happen</strong>." (the possibility of it happening)</li>
            <li>"If I <strong>can build</strong> a working prototype..." (the ability to build it)</li>
            <li>"Let me know when you're rich and <strong>can buy</strong> me a lifetime supply..." (the ability to buy)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Need to:</strong> Used to express necessity or obligation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject + need to + base verb</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <em>Example from dialogue:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>"I <strong>need to build</strong> a prototype first." (It is necessary to build it)</li>
