    <h1>Dialogue</h1>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, did you see that article about the G7 Summit on AI governance?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! I skimmed it. My main takeaway was 'robots won't be able to order my pizza for me... yet.'</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, well, it's a bit more serious than pizza. They're trying to set up some rules for AI development.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Rules? Like, 'AI must not develop a sarcastic tone when responding to my silly questions'?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: More like, 'AI must be safe, secure, and trustworthy'. And ensure human oversight, of course.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So, my toaster won't secretly plot world domination while making my breakfast? Good to know.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly. They're talking about things like data privacy, intellectual property, and ensuring AI benefits everyone, not just a few.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I just hope they address the 'AI-powered cat video addiction' crisis. My productivity is plummeting.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That's probably not top of their agenda, but they are discussing ethical guidelines. Like, no AI deepfakes used for political mischief.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Good point. Imagine an AI version of me trying to convince you to lend me money. I'd be out of cash constantly.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: They're also looking at international cooperation to make sure these rules are consistent across countries.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So, an AI in Japan won't have different ethics than an AI in, say, Italy? Like different rules for parallel parking?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Pretty much! The goal is to prevent a 'wild west' scenario where every country has its own chaotic rules.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Makes sense. We don't want Skynet before we've even figured out how to make self-tying shoelaces work consistently.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Precisely. It's about getting ahead of the curve, even if it sounds a bit like a sci-fi convention.</p>

    <h1>Current Situation</h1>

    <p>The G7 (Group of Seven) nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus the European Union – have been actively discussing Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance. Recognizing the transformative power of AI and its potential risks, they aim to establish a common international framework for its development and use. Key themes include ensuring AI is safe, secure, and trustworthy, promoting human-centric AI, protecting data privacy, safeguarding intellectual property, and addressing issues like deepfakes and misinformation. The "Hiroshima AI Process," launched during Japan's G7 presidency in 2023, has been a significant initiative, leading to a voluntary International Code of Conduct for AI developers. The goal is to foster global cooperation to manage AI's rapid evolution, mitigate its dangers, and maximize its benefits for all, preventing a fragmented or 'wild west' approach to AI regulation worldwide.</p>

    <h1>Grammar Points</h1>

    <h2>1. Modal Verbs for Obligation, Prohibition, and Possibility</h2>
    <p>Modal verbs like 'must', 'won't be able to', 'should', and 'can' express different levels of certainty, necessity, or permission.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Must</strong>: Expresses strong obligation or a strong deduction/certainty.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>AI <strong>must</strong> be safe, secure, and trustworthy.</em> (Obligation)</span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>You <strong>must</strong> complete this task by Friday.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Won't be able to / Will not be able to</strong>: Expresses an inability or prohibition in the future.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>Robots <strong>won't be able to</strong> order my pizza for me... yet.</em> (Future inability)</span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>If we don't fix this, we <strong>won't be able to</strong> launch the product.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Should</strong>: Expresses advice, recommendation, or a weaker obligation than 'must'.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>You <strong>should</strong> always back up your important files.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Can / Can't</strong>: Expresses ability/possibility or inability/prohibition.
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>We <strong>can</strong> develop AI responsibly.</em></span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>They <strong>can't</strong> ignore the ethical concerns.</em></span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Conditional Sentences (Type 2) for Imaginary Situations</h2>
    <p>Type 2 conditionals are used to talk about hypothetical or imaginary situations in the present or future and their likely results. These situations are often contrary to known facts or highly unlikely.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure: If + simple past, ... would + base form of verb</strong></p>
    <span class="example-sentence"><em>Imagine an AI version of me trying to convince you to lend me money. I'd be out of cash constantly.</em></span>
    <p>This means: "If an AI version of me *tried* to convince you... I *would be* out of cash." The situation (an AI version of me) is imaginary.</p>
    <span class="example-sentence"><em>If I <strong>were</strong> a millionaire, I <strong>would travel</strong> the world.</em> (But I'm not a millionaire.)</span>
    <span class="example-sentence"><em>If she <strong>knew</strong> the answer, she <strong>would tell</strong> us.</em> (But she doesn't know the answer.)</span>
