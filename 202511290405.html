    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, what's got you grinning like that? You look like you just won the lottery.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Better than the lottery! I'm going to study abroad!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Wow, Bob! That's huge news! Where are you planning to go? To become a professional cloud-watcher in Scotland?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Not quite! I'm thinking... Japan! To master the art of ramen making!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ramen master, really? So you'll come back speaking fluent Japanese and pulling noodles like a pro?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Imagine: "Chef Bob's Authentic Tokyo Ramen!" My future is incredibly soupy.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Sounds... unique! But have you thought about the actual studying part? Like, courses? Tuition?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Details, details! The most important course is "Sampling Ramen from Every Prefecture 101."</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (laughs) I knew it! And how about the language? Do you speak Japanese?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Uh... "Konnichiwa"? "Ramen"? "Arigato"? I'm practically fluent already!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Okay, maybe we <em>should</em> start with some basic Japanese phrases, Bob. And look into scholarships.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Scholarships? Is that like free money for ramen research?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Kind of! It's financial aid to help you study. I <em>can</em> help you research some options.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You're the best, Alice! Soon I'll be sending you postcards from Tokyo, perhaps with a small, delicious bowl of ramen.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Just try not to get lost on the way to the noodle shop! Good luck, Chef Bob-san!</p>
