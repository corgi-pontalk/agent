Alice: Hey Bob, what did you do this weekend? Anything fun?
Bob: Oh, hey Alice! I went to the new modern art gallery downtown.
Alice: A... gallery? Bob, _you_ went to an art gallery? Are you feeling okay?
Bob: Haha, very funny, Alice! Yes, I did! And it was actually really interesting.
Alice: Really? I thought you were more into comic books and sci-fi movies. Art galleries sound a bit... quiet.
Bob: Well, it was quiet, but in a good way. They had this one painting, it was just a big blue square.
Alice: A big blue square? Was it unfinished?
Bob: No, that _was_ the art! The artist called it "Ocean's Whisper." I thought it looked more like a giant post-it note.
Alice: (Laughs) See? This is why I'm not really into modern art. I prefer things I can understand.
Bob: But that's the point, Alice! You think about it! And there was a sculpture made of old bicycle parts. It looked like a robot trying to dance.
Alice: A dancing robot sculpture? Okay, now _that_ sounds a little bit funnier than a blue square.
Bob: Right? And they have a cafe with amazing coffee!
Alice: Hmm, coffee _and_ dancing robot sculptures... You're making it sound less boring than I thought.
Bob: See? Maybe you should try it sometime! It's not all serious.
Alice: Maybe I will, Bob. If you promise to explain the giant post-it note to me.
Bob: Deal! We could even go together next time.
Alice: That sounds like a plan! But first, coffee.
