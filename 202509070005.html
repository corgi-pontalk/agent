    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, fancy meeting you here! What's got you looking so... intense?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Just trying to <span class="key-phrase">wrap my head around</span> 'ASEAN and Regional Security'. It sounds like a secret agent movie, but with more acronyms.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: ASEAN? Is that like a <span class="key-phrase">superhero team</span> of countries, fighting evil with treaties and memorandums?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Kinda! It stands for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Ten countries, aiming for economic growth, social progress, and, yes, regional peace and stability.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: So, they're basically the <span class="key-phrase">cool kids' club</span> of Southeast Asia, making sure no one starts a <span class="key-phrase">food fight</span> at the global lunch table?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Precisely! Except the 'food fights' can be a bit more serious, like <span class="key-phrase">territorial disputes</span> or <span class="key-phrase">maritime security challenges</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Ah, so they're like the <span class="key-phrase">neighborhood watch</span>, but for an entire sea. Do they patrol in speedboats, shouting 'No littering in international waters!'?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: More like coordinating diplomatic efforts and joint exercises to address things like piracy, climate change impacts, or even cyber threats.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Cyber threats? Are they worried about someone hacking their pineapple supply chain? Because that would be a true regional crisis!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Not <em>just</em> pineapples, Alice! Think critical infrastructure, data security... it's a big deal.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: And what about the 'big brothers' of the world? Do they try to <span class="key-phrase">muscle in on</span> ASEAN's playground?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: They definitely interact with major powers like China, the US, and Japan. ASEAN aims to <span class="key-phrase">maintain its centrality</span> and not become a <span class="key-phrase">pawn in bigger power games</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: So, they're trying to keep the peace, grow their economies, <em>and</em> tell the global giants, 'Thanks, but we've got this'?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Pretty much! It's a <span class="key-phrase">delicate balancing act</span>, but their cooperative approach has been quite successful in <span class="key-phrase">fostering stability</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hmm, maybe I should apply for a job there. I'm excellent at <span class="key-phrase">mediating disputes</span> over the last slice of pizza. That's practically international diplomacy!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: You're hired! Now, about that last slice of geopolitical pizza...</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional intergovernmental organization comprising ten Southeast Asian countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Established in 1967, its primary aims include accelerating economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, and promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
    <p>In terms of regional security, ASEAN plays a crucial role as a central forum for dialogue and cooperation. It addresses a range of challenges, including traditional security threats like territorial disputes (most notably in the South China Sea) and transnational crime (e.g., piracy, drug trafficking). Non-traditional security concerns, such as climate change impacts, cyber threats, and pandemics, are also high on its agenda.</p>
    <p>ASEAN's approach to security is characterized by a commitment to multilateralism, a non-interference policy in internal affairs, and a consensus-based decision-making process. It seeks to maintain its "centrality" in the evolving Indo-Pacific regional architecture, engaging with major external powers like the United States, China, Japan, India, and the European Union through various dialogue mechanisms (e.g., ASEAN Regional Forum, East Asia Summit). This allows it to manage complex geopolitical dynamics and prevent the region from becoming an arena for great power competition, thereby fostering a stable and peaceful environment conducive to economic prosperity.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>Phrasal verbs combine a verb with a preposition or an adverb (or both) to create a new meaning that is often different from the individual words.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wrap my head around:</strong> (verb + preposition) to understand something complicated.
                <span class="example-sentence">"It took me a while to wrap my head around quantum physics."</span></li>
            <li><strong>Muscle in on:</strong> (verb + adverb + preposition) to involve oneself forcefully or intrusively.
                <span class="example-sentence">"He tried to muscle in on their conversation, but they ignored him."</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Metaphorical Language and Idioms</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>Metaphors and idioms are expressions that use figurative language to create vivid images or convey meanings not literally expressed by the words themselves. They make language more colorful and engaging.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cool kids' club:</strong> (Idiom) A popular, often exclusive, group.
                <span class="example-sentence">"Only senior students got into the debate club – it was like a cool kids' club."</span></li>
            <li><strong>Food fight:</strong> (Metaphorical) A trivial or messy argument or conflict.
                <span class="example-sentence">"Their board meeting sometimes turned into a political food fight."</span></li>
            <li><strong>Delicate balancing act:</strong> (Idiom) A situation that requires very careful and precise management of opposing elements.
                <span class="example-sentence">"The chef performed a delicate balancing act to ensure all the dishes were ready at the same time."</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Gerunds (-ing form)</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>A gerund is a verb form ending in -ing that functions as a noun. It can be the subject of a sentence, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>As Object of a Preposition:</strong> "Just trying to wrap my head around..." (Here, "around" is a preposition, and "wrapping" is implied as the gerund that follows, though the phrase uses the infinitive "to wrap" to show intention. Let's use a clear example from the dialogue.)
                <span class="example-sentence">"Their cooperative approach has been successful in <strong>fostering</strong> stability." (Here, "fostering" is a gerund acting as the object of the preposition "in".)</span></li>
            <li><strong>As Object of a Verb:</strong> "I'm excellent at <strong>mediating</strong> disputes." (Here, "mediating" is a gerund acting as the object of the preposition "at".)</li>
            <li><strong>As part of a compound noun/phrase:</strong> "<strong>Aiming</strong> for economic growth..." (Here, "aiming" is a present participle modifying "countries," but it demonstrates the -ing form in action.)
                <span class="example-sentence">"<strong>Reading</strong> is my favorite hobby." (Gerund as subject.)</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
