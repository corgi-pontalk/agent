Alice: Bob, I need your help!
Bob: Alice, what's up?
Alice: My boss wants me to do social media marketing. I don't even know what that means!
Bob: Oh, it's easy! It's just... posting silly pictures online.
Alice: Silly pictures? For our new super-serious accounting software?
Bob: Well, maybe not *super* silly. More like 'engaging' silly. Like a cat doing taxes!
Alice: A cat doing taxes... You're kidding, right?
Bob: Nope! Think 'viral content.' People love cute animals. Or dancing avocados!
Alice: Dancing avocados? Bob, this is for a B2B audience!
Bob: Even B2B people scroll TikTok, Alice! We need to 'reach our audience'.
Alice: So, I need to 'create content' that goes 'viral'?
Bob: Exactly! And don't forget 'hashtags'! #TaxCat #AvocadoAccounting.
Alice: This sounds more like a comedy show than marketing.
Bob: Welcome to the internet, my friend! It's all about getting 'likes and shares'.
Alice: Okay, fine. But if my boss asks for dancing avocados, I'm blaming you.
Bob: Deal! Just make sure they're happy avocados!
