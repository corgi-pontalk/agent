    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, are you sure this is platform 7? It looks more like a car park entrance!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, don't worry! My phone says "Platform 7, Gate B". We're practically there. Oh, wait...</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: What now, Bob? Did your phone just suggest we board a pigeon?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: No, no! It just updated. "Platform 7, Gate B, <em>train to Puddleburg</em>". Is that us?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Puddleburg? Bob, we're going to Sunnyville! We talked about this for weeks!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, right! Sunnyville! My bad. So, not this train then. Good catch, Alice!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: <em>Sigh</em>. Let's find the departure board again. It's usually... shiny and big.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Aha! Found it! Okay, Sunnyville... Platform 3! Oh, it leaves in two minutes!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Two minutes?! Bob, run! My giant backpack is not built for speed!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Don't worry, I'll carry your... actually, no, I'll just run ahead and hold the doors!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, you can't "hold the doors" on a train like it's an elevator!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Watch me! <em>He runs off, nearly tripping</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (to herself) And he wonders why I always pack snacks for <em>emergencies</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (shouting from a distance) Alice! I see it! It's bright yellow!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: That's a taxi, Bob! Our train is usually... train-shaped!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh. Right. Well, the <em>next</em> train is in 30 minutes! Plenty of time for snacks?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, you're lucky I like you. Let's just find Platform 3, slowly this time.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Train stations are bustling places where people go to catch trains for travel. At a train station, you can usually find a <strong>ticket office</strong> or <strong>ticket machines</strong> to buy your tickets. Large screens called <strong>departure boards</strong> show important information like train times, destinations, and which <strong>platform</strong> your train will leave from. A platform is the area next to the train tracks where you wait to <strong>board a train</strong>. Trains can be local, for short trips, or intercity for longer journeys. Many travelers use digital tickets on their phones, but paper tickets are still common. It's always a good idea to arrive a bit early and check the information carefully so you don't <strong>miss your train</strong>!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. The Verb "To Be" (is, are)</h3>
    <p>The verb "to be" is very common and essential. We use "is" for singular nouns (one thing) and "are" for plural nouns (more than one thing) or with "you."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>This is</strong> platform 7. (Singular)</li>
        <li>We <strong>are</strong> at the station. (Plural/With 'we')</li>
        <li>It <strong>is</strong> bright yellow. (Singular)</li>
        <li>You <strong>are</strong> lucky. (With 'you')</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Prepositions of Place (at, on, to, from)</h3>
    <p>These small words tell us about location and direction.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>At</strong>: Used for a general location or specific address.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> We are <strong>at</strong> the train station.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>On</strong>: Used for a surface or a specific line (like a platform).
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> The train is <strong>on</strong> Platform 3.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>To</strong>: Used for direction or destination.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> We are going <strong>to</strong> Sunnyville.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>From</strong>: Used for origin or starting point.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> The train leaves <strong>from</strong> Platform 3.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Imperative Sentences</h3>
    <p>We use imperative sentences to give commands, instructions, or make requests. They usually start with the base form of a verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Run!</strong> (Command)</li>
        <li><strong>Don't worry!</strong> (Negative command/request)</li>
        <li><strong>Let's find</strong> the departure board. (Suggestion, starting with "Let's")</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Asking Questions with "Is/Are"</h3>
    <p>To ask simple yes/no questions or about identity/location, we often start with "Is" or "Are."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Is</strong> this our train?</li>
        <li><strong>Are</strong> you sure?</li>
        <li><strong>Is</strong> it bright yellow?</li>
    </ul>
