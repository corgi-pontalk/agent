    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, Bob, have you been following the news about the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace talks? It feels like it's been going on forever!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Funny you mention it. I just saw a headline. They're still at it, apparently. Negotiating borders, enclaves, all that jazz.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "All that jazz"? Bob, it's quite serious, isn't it? My understanding is they're trying to figure out some really sticky issues.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Absolutely, absolutely. My point is, it’s like a never-ending chess game, but with actual countries. I read somewhere they're discussing a "peace treaty."</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A "peace treaty" would be wonderful, of course. But they've been at this off-and-on for decades, haven't they? It's like waiting for a second season of your favourite show that never quite arrives.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> More like waiting for a *final* season, Alice, that keeps getting delayed. I heard the latest snag is over, uh, "corridors." You know, access routes.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ah, the "Zangezur corridor" issue. Or is it just "corridor"? I always get those details mixed up. Is it for people, goods, or both?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Both, I think! And it's super complicated because one side wants free movement, and the other side is like, "Hold on a minute, what about our sovereignty?" Total diplomatic headache.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Sounds like a diplomatic migraine. I just hope they can finally come to an agreement. Imagine the sigh of relief.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Tell me about it. It’s like when you finally decide what to order for dinner after an hour of scrolling. Monumental.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Except the stakes are a *tad* higher than whether to get pizza or tacos, Bob.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, fair point. But the emotional investment is similar, right? All that anticipation! My biggest worry is that they'll agree, and then a week later, something else pops up.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Don't jinx it! Let's stay optimistic. Maybe they'll shake hands and everyone can finally move forward.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Fingers crossed! I just hope they don't invite *me* to mediate. My negotiating skills usually involve convincing my cat to take his medicine. It doesn't always end peacefully.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I can imagine. Well, let's hope for a breakthrough. No cat-level diplomacy required.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The Armenia-Azerbaijan peace talks are ongoing efforts to resolve the long-standing conflict between the two South Caucasus nations, primarily centered around the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Decades of tension and sporadic armed conflict have led to significant loss of life and displacement. Mediated by various international actors, including the European Union, the United States, and Russia, the talks aim to establish a lasting peace treaty. Key issues on the agenda include border delimitation, the status of enclaves, the opening of communication routes (often referred to as "corridors"), and the return of displaced persons. Despite numerous rounds of negotiations and optimistic statements, a comprehensive agreement has yet to be reached, with various sticking points continuing to challenge the diplomatic process.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peace talks:</strong> Ongoing discussions between conflicting parties aimed at resolving disputes and establishing peace.
            <br><em>Example:</em> The two nations have resumed <strong>peace talks</strong> after a year-long hiatus.</li>
        <li><strong>Sticky issues:</strong> Difficult or sensitive problems that are challenging to resolve.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Child custody is often one of the <strong>sticky issues</strong> in a divorce.</li>
        <li><strong>Come to an agreement:</strong> To reach a mutual decision, settlement, or understanding after discussion.
            <br><em>Example:</em> After hours of negotiation, they finally <strong>came to an agreement</strong> on the contract terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't jinx it!:</strong> An idiom used to ask someone not to say anything that might cause a desired positive outcome not to happen, often out of superstition.
            <br><em>Example:</em> "I think I'm going to get the promotion." "Shh, <strong>don't jinx it</strong>!"</li>
        <li><strong>A breakthrough:</strong> A sudden, important discovery or success, especially one that removes an obstacle.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Scientists are hoping for <strong>a breakthrough</strong> in cancer research.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phrasal Verbs with "On":</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Go on:</strong> To happen; to continue.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "It feels like it's been <strong>going on</strong> forever!"
                    <br><em>Another example:</em> "What's <strong>going on</strong> here?" (What's happening?)</li>
                <li><strong>Hold on:</strong> To wait for a short time; to pause.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "...one side is like, '<strong>Hold on</strong> a minute, what about our sovereignty?'"
                    <br><em>Another example:</em> "Please <strong>hold on</strong>, I'll be with you in a moment."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Idiomatic Expressions (Informal Language):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All that jazz:</strong> And all the related things; and so on; etc. (Used informally to refer to things that are similar to something just mentioned).
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Negotiating borders, enclaves, <strong>all that jazz</strong>."
                    <br><em>Another example:</em> "She likes painting, drawing, sculpture, and <strong>all that jazz</strong>."</li>
                <li><strong>Tell me about it:</strong> Used informally to express that you understand or agree with what someone is saying, usually because you have experienced the same thing.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>Tell me about it</strong>. It’s like when you finally decide what to order for dinner..."
                    <br><em>Another example:</em> "This traffic is terrible." "<strong>Tell me about it</strong>! I've been stuck here for an hour."</li>
                <li><strong>A tad:</strong> A small amount; slightly.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Except the stakes are <strong>a tad</strong> higher than whether to get pizza or tacos, Bob."
                    <br><em>Another example:</em> "The soup is <strong>a tad</strong> too salty for my taste."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Conditional Sentences (Type 1):</strong>
            <p>Type 1 conditionals describe real or very probable situations in the present or future. The structure is generally: <strong>If + Simple Present, Will + Base Verb</strong>. However, other modal verbs (like 'can', 'may', 'might', 'should') can also be used in the main clause.</p>
            <br><em>Example from dialogue (implied):</em> "Maybe they'll shake hands and everyone can finally move forward." (Implies: If they shake hands, everyone can move forward.)
            <br><em>Another example from dialogue:</em> "My biggest worry is that they'll agree, and then a week later, something else pops up." (Here, "they'll agree" acts as the conditional event).
            <br><em>Classic example:</em> "If it rains, we will stay home."
            <br><em>Using a modal:</em> "If you study hard, you might pass the exam."</li>
    </ul>
