    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, seriously, my latest electricity bill just went through the roof! I'm practically living in a cave to save energy.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, tell me about it! My landlord just informed us he's thinking of heating the entire building with warm thoughts this winter. It's the European energy crisis, you know.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, right, the one where everyone's suddenly an expert in natural gas futures? I thought it was just my old fridge staging a rebellion.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Nope, it's bigger than your fridge, unfortunately. Geopolitical tensions, supply chain woes... it's a whole cocktail of chaos that's hitting our wallets hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: So, we're talking about wearing three sweaters indoors and showering with a timer now? Because I'm already halfway there.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Pretty much! Businesses are getting squeezed too. Some factories are having to cut back production because energy costs are just unsustainable. It's a proper crunch time for many.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: And I thought my biggest problem was deciding what to binge-watch next. This sounds like a really tight spot for everyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It is. Governments are trying to find solutions, like boosting renewable energy and securing alternative supplies, but it's not an overnight fix.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: So, no magic button that just makes gas prices drop then? My dreams of a perpetually warm apartment are crumbling.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Afraid not. It's a complex dance between demand, supply, and a bit of political poker. The ripple effect is affecting everything, from food prices to manufacturing.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A ripple effect? So my lukewarm coffee is connected to global politics? Mind-blowing.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Absolutely. It's all part of the domino effect. When energy gets expensive, everything else tends to follow suit.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, I guess I should brace myself for more cold showers and high bills. At least I'll save money on ice cubes.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: There's the spirit! We'll get through it. Maybe we can all just huddle together for warmth? Just kidding... mostly.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha! Thanks for the doom and gloom, Bob. At least now I know it's not just my rogue fridge.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The European energy market has faced significant challenges in recent years, largely due to a confluence of factors. Geopolitical events, particularly the conflict in Ukraine, have severely disrupted the supply of natural gas from Russia, a major energy provider to Europe. This has led to sharp increases in gas and electricity prices. Additionally, underinvestment in traditional energy infrastructure, coupled with a push towards renewable energy sources that can be intermittent (like wind and solar), has created supply vulnerabilities. High demand post-pandemic further strained resources. This crisis has resulted in soaring energy bills for households, forcing many to adopt energy-saving measures, and has pushed many businesses to reduce production or even close, impacting the wider economy through inflation and supply chain issues.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>go through the roof</strong>: To increase to a very high level.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Housing prices in the city have really gone through the roof this year."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>tell me about it!</strong>: An informal expression used to show that you understand and agree with what someone is saying because you have had the same experience.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Working overtime again? Oh, tell me about it! I haven't seen my bed before midnight all week."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>hit (someone/something) hard</strong>: To affect someone or something severely or negatively.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "The new taxes are going to hit small businesses hard."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>crunch time</strong>: A period when a lot of work has to be done in a short time.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "It's crunch time before the project deadline, so everyone is working extra hours."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>tight spot</strong>: A difficult situation.

        </li>
        <li><strong>domino effect</strong>: A situation in which one event causes a series of similar events to happen one after the other. (Similar to ripple effect, but often implies a sequence of clear, distinct events following one another).
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "If one bank fails, it could create a domino effect throughout the financial system."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>brace yourself</strong>: To prepare yourself for something difficult or unpleasant that is going to happen.

    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Phrasal Verbs in Context</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with a preposition or an adverb (or both) to create a new meaning. They are very common in informal English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>go through the roof</strong> (verb + prepositional phrase): As seen above, means to increase rapidly.
            <p class="example-sentence">"My blood pressure tends to go through the roof when I get stuck in traffic."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>cut back (on)</strong> (verb + adverb): To reduce the amount of something.
            <p class="example-sentence">"Many people are trying to cut back on their spending due to inflation."</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">"The company had to cut back production due to high energy costs."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>huddle together</strong> (verb + adverb): To crowd together closely, often for warmth or comfort.
            <p class="example-sentence">"The campers had to huddle together around the fire to stay warm."</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Expressing Cause and Effect</h3>
    <p>The dialogue uses several ways to show how one event leads to another.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"due to..." / "because of..."</strong>: These prepositions introduce the reason or cause.
            <p class="example-sentence">"The flight was delayed <strong>due to</strong> bad weather."</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">"She was late <strong>because of</strong> heavy traffic."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"lead to..." / "result in..."</strong>: These verbs show the outcome or consequence.
            <p class="example-sentence">"Lack of sleep can <strong>lead to</strong> poor concentration."</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">"His hard work <strong>resulted in</strong> a promotion."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"affecting everything from... to..."</strong>: This structure is used to list the range of things impacted by something.
            <p class="example-sentence">"The new policy is affecting everything from student enrollment to faculty salaries."</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
