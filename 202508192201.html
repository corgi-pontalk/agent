    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, Bob, I'm so swamped with this history essay! My brain feels like scrambled eggs.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Why don't you just ask ChatGPT? It's a lifesaver, honestly. Saves me hours of staring at a blank screen.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: ChatGPT? Isn't that like... cheating? I've heard of OpenAI, but I didn't realize their AI could help with essays.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Not if you use it smartly, Alice! It's a generative AI from OpenAI. It can brainstorm, summarize, even help structure your arguments. Think of it as a super-smart assistant, not a ghostwriter.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hmm, I guess I'm a bit behind the curve. So, it actually writes coherent sentences? I once tried a terrible online spinner tool, and it just created gibberish.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, this is light years ahead of those. I once asked it to write a limerick about a confused squirrel trying to open a jar, and it absolutely nailed it. Rhymed 'tree' with 'decree' perfectly!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: A limerick about a squirrel? You're joking! I need a cohesive argument on the Napoleonic Wars, not poetry!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Believe me, it handles complex topics too. Just don't copy-paste its output directly. Use it to get unstuck, or to quickly grasp a concept. It's truly a game-changer for productivity.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: A game-changer, huh? I'm picturing robots taking over all the writing jobs now. My future career as a novelist is looking bleak!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Nah, it's more of a co-pilot. Human creativity and critical thinking are still irreplaceable. For now, anyway!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: "For now"? You're just trying to scare me, aren't you? Alright, alright, point me to this OpenAI wizardry. My brain is legitimately fried from research.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Just search "ChatGPT OpenAI". Prepare to have your mind blown... or at least your essay draft started in record time.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: If it helps me get a good grade, I'm buying you coffee. If it makes me sound like a robot, you're writing my next one!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Deal! But seriously, use it responsibly. It's a powerful tool, not a magic cheat sheet.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Understood. Fingers crossed it doesn't give me a historical essay written in rap lyrics.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <div>
        <p>OpenAI is a leading artificial intelligence research company known for developing advanced AI models. ChatGPT, one of their most prominent creations, is a large language model (LLM) designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the prompts it receives. Since its public release, it has rapidly gained widespread attention for its ability to perform various tasks, from answering questions and writing creative content to summarizing complex information and even assisting with coding.</p>
        <p>ChatGPT and similar AI tools have become significant topics in education, professional industries, and daily life. They offer unprecedented opportunities for productivity, learning, and creativity, acting as powerful "co-pilots" for many tasks. However, their use also raises important discussions about academic integrity, potential for misinformation, data privacy, and the evolving nature of human work. OpenAI continues to update and improve its models, making them more capable and addressing ethical concerns, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>1. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning different from the original verb. They are very common in spoken English.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Swamped with</b>: (verb + preposition) to be overwhelmed or burdened with.
                <p class="example-sentence">He's <i>swamped with</i> deadlines this week.</p></li>
            <li><b>Take over</b>: (verb + adverb) to gain control of something; to replace someone or something.
                <p class="example-sentence">Robots might <i>take over</i> repetitive factory jobs in the future.</p></li>
            <li><b>Point to</b>: (verb + preposition) to show the way to; to indicate. (In this context, "point me to" means "show me where to find").
                <p class="example-sentence">The librarian can <i>point you to</i> the best resources for your research.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Idiomatic Expressions (Informal Language)</h3>
        <p>Idioms are phrases or expressions where the meaning cannot be deduced from the literal definition of the words. They add color and naturalness to conversations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Scrambled eggs (brain feels like)</b>: Means your mind is confused or disorganized, usually from being overworked.
                <p class="example-sentence">After studying for 10 hours, my brain feels like <i>scrambled eggs</i>.</p></li>
            <li><b>Light years ahead</b>: A very long way in advance of someone or something else; far superior.
                <p class="example-sentence">Their new software is <i>light years ahead</i> of the competition.</p></li>
            <li><b>Brain is fried/legitimately fried</b>: To be extremely tired mentally, unable to think clearly.
                <p class="example-sentence">I've been working all day; my <i>brain is fried</i>.</p></li>
        </ul>
