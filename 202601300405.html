    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, did you see that crazy cat video online yesterday? My sister shared it!</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! I almost dropped my coffee laughing. That cat was a true internet sensation!</p>
        <p>Alice: Right? I usually just watch my favorite TV show in the evenings.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, which one? The new detective series?</p>
        <p>Alice: No, the comedy one! But yesterday I also listened to a really interesting podcast about history.</p>
        <p>Bob: A podcast? Wow, you're so cultured! I was just scrolling through my social media feed, looking at funny posts.</p>
        <p>Alice: You spend all your time on social media, don't you? What about the news?</p>
        <p>Bob: News? Uh, I saw a headline about a giant pizza on a news app. Does that count?</p>
        <p>Alice: (Sighs dramatically) Bob, you need to read a newspaper sometimes, or watch a documentary!</p>
        <p>Bob: I did watch a movie last night on a new streaming service. It was a really long one!</p>
        <p>Alice: Was it good? Or just long?</p>
        <p>Bob: It was... long. And it had too many commercials! Seriously, can't they just put them all at the end?</p>
        <p>Alice: That's why I prefer subscription services. No ads!</p>
        <p>Bob: True. But sometimes I like flipping through a magazine. You know, for the pictures.</p>
        <p>Alice: (Laughing) Of course, Bob. The pictures. So, what's the next viral video you're planning to send me?</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, just wait. I found a really silly advertisement for a new snack. It's going to be huge!</p>
        <p>Alice: Can't wait. (Sarcastically) My media diet is always so balanced thanks to you.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Present Simple (for Habits and Routines)</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple tense to talk about actions that happen regularly, often, or are generally true.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + Base Verb (e.g., I watch, you read)
            <ul>
                <li>For he/she/it, we add '-s' or '-es' to the verb (e.g., he watches, she reads, it scrolls).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"I <code>watch</code> TV in the evenings." (A regular habit)</li>
                <li>"He <code>scrolls</code> through his social media feed." (A routine)</li>
                <li>"Alice <code>listens</code> to podcasts." (A general truth about Alice)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Past Simple (for Completed Actions)</h3>
    <p>We use the Past Simple tense to talk about actions that started and finished at a specific time in the past.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + Verb + '-ed' (for regular verbs) OR Irregular Verb (e.g., watched, listened, saw).
            <ul>
                <li>Regular verbs add '-ed' (e.g., watch -> watched, listen -> listened, scroll -> scrolled).</li>
                <li>Irregular verbs change their form (e.g., see -> saw, read -> read (pronunciation changes), know -> knew).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"Yesterday, I <code>listened</code> to a history podcast." (The action of listening is finished)</li>
                <li>"Last night, Bob <code>watched</code> a movie." (The action of watching is finished)</li>
                <li>"I <code>saw</code> a funny video online." (The action of seeing is finished)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Common Verbs for Media Activities</h3>
    <p>Different media types often pair with specific verbs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Watch:</strong> TV, movies, videos, documentaries, series, shows
            <p>Example: "Let's <code>watch</code> that new movie."</p></li>
