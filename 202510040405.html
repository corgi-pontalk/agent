    <h1>Dialogue</h1>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob! What happened to your arm?! It looks like it wrestled a porcupine!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Oh, just a little... gardening incident. Don't worry, the porcupine is fine.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Gardening? Did a rogue tomato attack you, or did you try to hug a rose bush without gloves?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Worse. I attempted to prune the giant cactus in my yard. With my bare hands. I thought it would be 'manly'.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Biting back laughter) Oh, Bob! You are absolutely unbelievable! What did the doctor say?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: He mostly just shook his head and gave me a very stern lecture about gardening safety. And then he picked out about fifty tiny spines.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Are you okay, though? Did they give you any special medicine or a giant "Do Not Prune Cacti" sign?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Just a few bandages and some antiseptic cream. And yes, a strong suggestion to buy proper gardening gloves. No sign, thankfully.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, you're at the hospital because you lost a fight with a plant? That's a story for the grandkids.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Pretty much! And they made me fill out so many forms. My hand was already tired from the cactus, now it's tired from writing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That's typical hospital procedure. They love their paperwork more than doctors love coffee.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And the waiting room music... let's just say it made the cactus spines feel pleasant by comparison.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Well, at least you're not seriously hurt, Bob. And you learned a valuable lesson, right?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Absolutely. Never underestimate a cactus. Or the power of a good pair of gloves.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Next time, call me. I'll lend you my superhero, impenetrable gardening gloves. They even come with a cape.</p>

    <h1>Current Situation</h1>
    <p>Going to the hospital can be for many reasons, from a small injury like Bob's cactus incident to more serious emergencies. When you arrive, especially for something unexpected, you'll often go to the Emergency Room (ER) or a walk-in clinic. You usually need to <strong>check in</strong> at the reception desk and <strong>fill out forms</strong> with your personal details and medical history. Then, you'll wait in a <strong>waiting room</strong> until a <strong>doctor</strong> or <strong>nurse</strong> can see you. They will ask you "<strong>What happened?</strong>" and "<strong>How do you feel?</strong>" to understand your situation. They might give you a <strong>bandage</strong>, some <strong>medicine</strong>, or schedule a follow-up <strong>appointment</strong>. It's important to be clear and honest about your symptoms so they can give you the best care!</p>

    <h1>Grammar Points</h1>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h2>1. Simple Past Tense</h2>
        <p>We use the <strong>Simple Past Tense</strong> to talk about actions that started and finished in the past. It's very common when describing events that already occurred, like a trip to the hospital!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular verbs</strong>: Add -ed to the base form (e.g., happen &rarr; happened, ask &rarr; asked, walk &rarr; walked).</li>
            <li><strong>Irregular verbs</strong>: Their forms change in different ways (e.g., say &rarr; said, go &rarr; went, see &rarr; saw, feel &rarr; felt, try &rarr; tried).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Examples from the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"What <strong>happened</strong> to your arm?" (from 'happen')</li>
            <li>"I <strong>attempted</strong> to prune the giant cactus." (from 'attempt')</li>
            <li>"He mostly just <strong>shook</strong> his head and <strong>gave</strong> me a very stern lecture." (from 'shake' and 'give')</li>
            <li>"They <strong>made</strong> me fill out so many forms." (from 'make')</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h2>2. The Verb "To Be" (Present and Past)</h2>
        <p>The verb "<strong>to be</strong>" is one of the most important verbs in English! We use it to describe states of being, characteristics, and locations. It changes form depending on the subject and the tense.</p>
        <p><strong>Present Tense:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I <strong>am</strong></li>
            <li>You/We/They <strong>are</strong></li>
            <li>He/She/It <strong>is</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Past Tense:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I/He/She/It <strong>was</strong></li>
            <li>You/We/They <strong>were</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Examples from the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"It <strong>looks</strong> like it wrestled a porcupine!" (present - describing current appearance. Note: 'looks' here is present simple, not 'to be', but it's about a current state). Let's use a better "to be" example from dialogue.</li>
            <li>"You <strong>are</strong> absolutely unbelievable!" (present - describing Alice's opinion of Bob)</li>
            <li>"Are you okay, though?" (present - asking about current well-being)</li>
            <li>"My hand <strong>was</strong> already tired from the cactus..." (past - describing a past state)</li>
        </ul>
