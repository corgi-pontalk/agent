    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, what are you up to now? You look deep in thought.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, hi Alice! Just calculating... Is it lunchtime yet? My stomach clock is very insistent.</p>
        <p>Alice: Haha! No, Bob, it's only 10 o'clock in the morning. We literally just finished breakfast an hour ago!</p>
        <p>Bob: Already? My internal clock must be set to "always hungry." So, what's happening this afternoon?</p>
        <p>Alice: We have our coffee date, remember? Around 3 PM. Don't you dare be late this time!</p>
        <p>Bob: Never! I'll be there on the dot. What about tomorrow? Park plans still on?</p>
        <p>Alice: Absolutely! Let's meet at 9:30 AM tomorrow morning. And please, try to arrive on time!</p>
        <p>Bob: I will! I promise! What did you do yesterday? I didn't see you.</p>
        <p>Alice: Yesterday evening, I went to a concert. It was amazing! I got home super late.</p>
        <p>Bob: Nice! I was busy all day yesterday studying. Hey, I have a quick meeting in five minutes, actually!</p>
        <p>Alice: In five minutes?! Bob, you always do this! You need to go right now!</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh no! You're right! Okay, gotta run! See you later this afternoon!</p>
        <p>Alice: Good luck! Try to check the time next time!</p>
        <p>Bob: I will! Bye, Alice!</p>
        <p>Alice: Bye, Bob!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Time expressions are super important in English! They help us talk about when things happen, whether it's in the past, present, or future. Imagine trying to make plans with a friend or telling a story without mentioning "when"! It would be very confusing. By using phrases like "yesterday," "now," "tomorrow," or "at 3 o'clock," we can clearly communicate our schedules, memories, and future events. Mastering these expressions is key to understanding and being understood in everyday English conversations.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepositions of Time: At, On, In</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>At</strong>: Used for specific times, clock times, and holidays.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Examples: <strong>at</strong> 7 o'clock, <strong>at</strong> noon, <strong>at</strong> night, <strong>at</strong> Christmas.</em></div></li>
        <li><strong>On</strong>: Used for specific days and dates.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Examples: <strong>on</strong> Monday, <strong>on</strong> July 4th, <strong>on</strong> my birthday.</em></div></li>
        <li><strong>In</strong>: Used for months, seasons, years, longer periods, and parts of the day (except "at night"). Also used to indicate a future time (e.g., "in five minutes").
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Examples: <strong>in</strong> July, <strong>in</strong> summer, <strong>in</strong> 2025, <strong>in</strong> the morning, <strong>in</strong> an hour.</em></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Adverbs of Time</h3>
    <p>Words that tell us when something happens. They often go at the beginning or end of a sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>now, immediately, right now</strong> (present)</li>
        <li><strong>yesterday, last week/month/year, ago</strong> (past)</li>
        <li><strong>tomorrow, next week/month/year, soon, later</strong> (future)</li>
        <div class="example-sentence"><em>Examples: I'll see you <strong>tomorrow</strong>. She arrived <strong>late</strong>. We just finished <strong>now</strong>.</em></div>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Using 'This', 'Last', 'Next'</h3>
    <p>These words help us refer to periods relative to the present.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>This</strong>: refers to the current period.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Examples: <strong>this morning</strong>, <strong>this week</strong>, <strong>this year</strong>.</em></div></li>
        <li><strong>Last</strong>: refers to the period immediately before the current one.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Examples: <strong>last night</strong>, <strong>last month</strong>, <strong>last summer</strong>.</em></div></li>
        <li><strong>Next</strong>: refers to the period immediately after the current one.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Examples: <strong>next Tuesday</strong>, <strong>next weekend</strong>, <strong>next year</strong>.</em></div></li>
    </ul>
