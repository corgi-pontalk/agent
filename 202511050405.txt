Alice: Hi Bob! Are we finally here? This hotel looks... interesting.
Bob: Alice! Yes, we made it! Don't worry, I'm an expert at hotel check-ins. Watch and learn.
Alice: Oh, really? An expert? Last time, you tried to check into a clothes store.
Bob: That was a *very* fancy boutique! Anyway, first, we need the "reception desk." It's like the hotel's brain.
Alice: I see the sign. Let's go.
Bob: Good morning! We have a reservation. My name is... (mumbles) Bob. Hotel Staff: Good morning. Can I have your last name, please?
Bob: Uh, Johnson! Bob Johnson. And my friend, Alice. We booked a room. Hotel Staff: Let me check. Ah, Bob Johnson, one room for two nights. Is that correct?
Alice: Yes, that's perfect! Hotel Staff: Great. Could I please have your ID and a credit card for the deposit?
Bob: ID... credit card... Uh oh. I think my wallet is still in the car. Alice, do you have yours?
Alice: (Sighs dramatically) Bob, the "expert." Here's my card. Next time, *I'll* be the expert. Hotel Staff: Thank you. Here are your key cards, Mr. Johnson. Your room number is 402. Enjoy your stay!
Bob: Room 402! See, Alice? Smooth as silk... almost. Let's find our room!
