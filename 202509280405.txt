Alice : Bob, are you sure this is platform 7? It looks more like a car park entrance! Bob : Alice, don't worry! My phone says "Platform 7, Gate B". We're practically there. Oh, wait... Alice : What now, Bob? Did your phone just suggest we board a pigeon? Bob : No, no! It just updated. "Platform 7, Gate B, _train to Puddleburg_ ". Is that us? Alice : Puddleburg? Bob, we're going to Sunnyville! We talked about this for weeks! Bob : Oh, right! Sunnyville! My bad. So, not this train then. Good catch, Alice! Alice : _Sigh_. Let's find the departure board again. It's usually... shiny and big. Bob : Aha! Found it! Okay, Sunnyville... Platform 3! Oh, it leaves in two minutes! Alice : Two minutes?! Bob, run! My giant backpack is not built for speed! Bob : Don't worry, I'll carry your... actually, no, I'll just run ahead and hold the doors! Alice : Bob, you can't "hold the doors" on a train like it's an elevator! Bob : Watch me! _He runs off, nearly tripping_. Alice : (to herself) And he wonders why I always pack snacks for _emergencies_. Bob : (shouting from a distance) Alice! I see it! It's bright yellow! Alice : That's a taxi, Bob! Our train is usually... train-shaped! Bob : Oh. Right. Well, the _next_ train is in 30 minutes! Plenty of time for snacks? Alice : Bob, you're lucky I like you. Let's just find Platform 3, slowly this time.
