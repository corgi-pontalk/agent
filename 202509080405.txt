Alice: Hi Bob! Wow, you look like a very sleepy cat today. Did you just wake up?
Bob: Alice, you know me too well! Yes, I did. My bed is just too comfy.
Alice: Too comfy? I wake up at 6 AM every day! The sun is my alarm clock.
Bob: Six AM?! Alice, that's still the middle of the night for me! I usually wake up around 9 AM.
Alice: Nine AM! What do you do then? I already finished my yoga and had a big, healthy breakfast.
Bob: I... uh... I usually eat breakfast then. Maybe a giant bowl of cereal. And then I think about taking a nap.
Alice: A nap after breakfast? Bob, you're amazing! I eat lunch around 1 PM. What about you?
Bob: Oh, lunch. I usually eat lunch a bit later, around 2 PM. After my "morning" nap, of course.
Alice: (Laughing) You are truly a master of relaxation! Do you ever do anything else?
Bob: Sure! I eat dinner around 7 PM. And then I watch some TV.
Alice: And when do you go to sleep? Do you sleep early after all that relaxing?
Bob: Hmm, I usually go to sleep around 11 PM. But sometimes I read a book until midnight.
Alice: So, you wake up late, eat late, nap, and then sleep late. You have a very... relaxed routine, Bob!
Bob: It's a special routine, Alice. It works for me! What about you, when do you go to sleep?
Alice: I go to sleep at 10 PM. Gotta get those 8 hours! Good night, Bob! Or, good morning for you!
Bob: (Yawns) Good... everything, Alice! See you later!
