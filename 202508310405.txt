Alice : Hey Bob, what are you looking at so intently? Are you trying to find a hidden treasure? Bob : Oh, hi Alice! Almost! I'm trying to draw this really cool... thing. But I'm completely stuck on its head! Alice : Let me see! Is it a monster? A secret alien pet? Bob : Kind of! It's supposed to be a robot, but his head looks like a... a... flat, giant button. Alice : You mean a circle? Like a big, round pizza! Bob : Yes! A pizza head! Perfect! And his body is like a big, solid book. Alice : Ah, a rectangle! Good, that's easy to draw. Like a door or a tall building. Bob : And his arms are like two long rulers. Alice : More rectangles! You're surprisingly good at finding shapes, Bob! Bob : But his feet... they're pointy, like a slice of pie. Alice : A triangle! So, a robot with a pizza head, a book body, ruler arms, and pie feet? He sounds delicious! Bob : Exactly! And his buttons are tiny little... dice! Alice : Those are squares , my friend! This robot is a shape party! What about his eyes? Bob : Uh, two more tiny circles for eyes, like small candies. He needs a nose, though. Hmm, what about a tiny, stretched-out circle? Alice : An oval! Excellent! You're practically a shape architect, Bob! Or a shape chef, if we keep talking about food. Bob : I think I prefer "shape chef." Now, where's my pizza-head robot's chef hat?
