    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh no, Bob, look at the time! We're going to be so late for the party!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Relax, Alice! We can just grab a taxi. It’ll be quick.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: But where is one? I don't see any around here!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hmm, let me open my taxi app... Oh, wait. My phone battery is super low!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Seriously? Bob, you <em>always</em> do this! Now what?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, okay! Plan B: we'll hail one. Just wave your arm like *this*! (Bob waves his arm wildly, looking a bit like he's swatting a giant invisible mosquito)</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, that's not how you hail a taxi! You look like you're trying to fly away!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, it's a very urgent flight! Anyway, how *do* you do it?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You need to stand closer to the curb and make eye contact with the driver. Look, there's one coming! Quick, try again!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, okay! (He steps forward and waves his hand more clearly.) Taxi! Hey!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good, he saw us! Quick, get in before he changes his mind!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (To driver) Excuse me, driver, can you take us to the Grand Hotel, please?</p>
        <p><strong>Driver</strong>: Sure thing. Hop in.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Whispering to Bob) Thanks for saving us, Bob, even with your... unique technique.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (Grinning) Hey, it worked! Next time, I'll teach you the 'Bob's super-taxi-hailing-dance'.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Sighs dramatically) Please don't. Just charge your phone.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Taking a taxi is a common way to travel in many cities around the world. In the past, people usually stood on the street and waved their arm to "hail" a taxi, like Alice and Bob tried to do. This is still possible in some places, especially in busy city centers. However, today, many people use smartphone apps like Uber or Lyft to book a taxi or a private car. These apps allow you to see the car's location, the driver's name, and the fare before you even get in. This makes taking a taxi more convenient and often safer. Whether you hail one from the street or book one with an app, knowing how to ask for your destination and confirm the ride is very useful for getting around!</p>

    <h2 class="grammar-points">Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. "Be Going To" for Future Predictions and Intentions</h3>
    <p>We use "be going to" (am/is/are + going to + base verb) to talk about future plans or predictions based on what we see now.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>From the dialogue:</em> "We<strong>'re going to be</strong> so late!" (Alice sees the time, she predicts they will be late.)</li>
        <li><em>Example 1 (Prediction):</em> "Look at those dark clouds! It<strong>'s going to rain</strong>."</li>
        <li><em>Example 2 (Intention/Plan):</em> "I<strong>'m going to visit</strong> my parents next week."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Imperatives (Commands/Instructions)</h3>
    <p>Imperatives are used to give commands, make requests, or give instructions. They use the base form of the verb and usually don't have a subject (because the subject "you" is understood).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>From the dialogue:</em> "<strong>Relax</strong>, Alice!" "<strong>Open</strong> my app..." "<strong>Hop in</strong>."</li>
        <li><em>Example 1:</em> "<strong>Stop</strong> here, please."</li>
        <li><em>Example 2:</em> "<strong>Listen</strong> carefully."</li>
        <li><em>Example 3 (Negative imperative):</em> "<strong>Don't worry</strong>!"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Making Requests with "Can you...?"</h3>
    <p>We use "Can you...?" to ask someone politely to do something.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>From the dialogue:</em> "Excuse me, driver, <strong>can you take us to</strong> the Grand Hotel, please?"</li>
        <li><em>Example 1:</em> "<strong>Can you help</strong> me with my bags?"</li>
        <li><em>Example 2:</em> "<strong>Can you close</strong> the window? It's cold."</li>
        <li><em>Example 3 (Negative answer):</em> "No, I <strong>can't</strong>." (It's also possible to say "I'm sorry, I can't.")</li>
    </ul>
