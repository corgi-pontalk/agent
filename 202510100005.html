    <h2>Dialogue</h2>

    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, did you see that news about the ancient footprints found in the UK?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! You mean the ones from, like, a <em>really</em> long time ago? I just skimmed the headline!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: "Skimmed the headline" is your specialty. Yes, <em>those</em> ones. Apparently, they're over 800,000 years old. Mind-boggling, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Eight hundred thousand? That's practically prehistoric! I can almost picture some ancient Brit trying to find their car keys, then just sighing and walking.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: More like trying to find a mammoth to chase, Bob. No car keys back then. And probably a lot more mud.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Mud, sure. But imagine the drama! "Oh no, I left my spear back at the cave!"</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Or "Whose muddy footprint is <em>this</em> on the clean cave floor again?" Ancient domestic disputes.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! I wonder what they were doing. Just strolling along, enjoying the scenery? Maybe going for an ancient jog?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Probably foraging for food or escaping a saber-toothed tiger. Not exactly a leisurely Sunday afternoon walk.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: You're ruining my romantic vision of ancient strolls! I was picturing them with little ancient binoculars.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: And ancient little hats, I suppose? Let's be real, it was probably chilly and damp. Classic British weather, even 800,000 years ago.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: True. So, what do you think they'll do with them? Put a little velvet rope around them?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: They're already eroding pretty fast, so probably more about documentation and preserving the data. Not exactly a theme park attraction.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Aww. No "Ancient Footprint Land"? What a missed opportunity. I was already planning my visit, trying to find <em>my</em> ancestral toe-print.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I think you're about 800,000 years too late, and a few evolutionary steps off, Bob.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A guy can dream, Alice! A guy can dream. Maybe <em>my</em> giant feet are a genetic throwback.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Highly unlikely. Now, fancy getting some coffee? We can leave our <em>modern</em> footprints on the pavement.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Lead the way, Alice! Just watch out for any unsuspecting ancient puddles.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The discovery of ancient hominin footprints at Happisburgh, Norfolk, in the UK, in 2013 (with research published in 2014), represents a groundbreaking moment in understanding early human migration and presence in Europe. These footprints, estimated to be over 800,000 years old, are the oldest known hominin footprints outside of Africa. They predate any previous evidence of human occupation in Northern Europe by hundreds of thousands of years. The prints were left by a group of early humans, possibly <em>Homo antecessor</em>, on an ancient estuary mudflat. Although they eroded quickly after exposure, researchers were able to create 3D models and casts, preserving vital information. This remarkable find provides direct evidence of the size, gait, and even the social dynamics of these ancient individuals, offering a unique glimpse into a very distant past when Britain was a peninsula connected to mainland Europe, and its climate was similar to modern-day Scandinavia.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Past Simple vs. Past Continuous</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Past Simple</strong> is used for completed actions in the past.
            <br><em>Example from dialogue: "Did you see that news...?"</em> (A completed action of seeing)
            <br><em>Example: Dinosaurs <strong>roamed</strong> the Earth during prehistoric times.</em> (A completed state/action in a past period)</li>
        <li><strong>Past Continuous</strong> is used for an action that was ongoing at a specific point in the past, often interrupted by another action, or to set a scene.
            <br><em>Example from dialogue: "I <strong>was picturing</strong> them with little ancient binoculars."</em> (An ongoing imagination in the past)
            <br><em>Example: While they <strong>were foraging</strong> for food, a saber-toothed tiger appeared.</em> (Ongoing action interrupted)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Speculation about the Past</h3>
    <p>When we want to guess or deduce what <em>might have happened</em> or <em>must have been true</em> in the past, we use modal verbs followed by <strong>have + past participle</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Must have + past participle</strong>: Used when we are almost certain about a past event or situation.
            <br><em>Example from dialogue: "The ground <strong>must have been</strong> quite soft."</em> (Strong deduction)</li>
        <li><strong>Could have + past participle</strong>: Used when something was possible in the past, but we don't know for sure if it happened, or one of several possibilities.
            <br><em>Example: They <strong>could have been</strong> hunting or gathering berries.</em> (One of several possibilities)</li>
        <li><strong>Might have + past participle / May have + past participle</strong>: Used for a possibility in the past, a bit less certain than 'could have'.
            <br><em>Example: They <strong>might have been</strong> migrating to a new area.</em> (It's possible, but less certain)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Present Perfect for Recent Events and Discoveries</h3>
    <p>The Present Perfect (<strong>have/has + past participle</strong>) is used to talk about actions or events that happened at an unspecified time in the past but have a connection to the present. It's often used for news or discoveries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue: "Did you see that news about the ancient footprints found in the UK?"</em> (The discovery happened in the past, but the news is recent and relevant now.)</li>
        <li><em>Example from text: "The discovery... <strong>has provided</strong> direct evidence..."</em> (The act of discovering happened, and the <em>result</em> – providing evidence – continues into the present.)</li>
        <li><strong>Key difference from Past Simple</strong>: If we know the exact time, we often use the Past Simple (e.g., "They <em>discovered</em> the footprints in 2013."). If the time is unspecified or the focus is on the present result, Present Perfect is preferred.</li>
    </ul>
