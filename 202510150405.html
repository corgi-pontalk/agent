    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hi Bob, what are you doing?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, hi Alice! I'm trying to beat this level in my new game. It's super hard!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Really? What game is it? Is it one of those monster-fighting games?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Kind of! It's 'Dragon Slayer 3'. The dragon just ate my magic boots again!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, sounds painful for your boots! Can I watch? Maybe I can give you some 'expert' advice.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You? Expert advice? Last time you played, you walked your character into a wall for five minutes!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That was strategy! I was checking the wall for secret passages! And it was a long time ago.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Sure, 'strategy'. Anyway, come here. See? This big red dragon, Sparky, keeps breathing fire.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Sparky? That's a cute name for a fire-breathing beast!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Don't let the name fool you. He's terrible! Look, I need to get the golden sword.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ah, the golden sword! Is it hidden in that giant mushroom?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: No, that's just a regular, bouncy mushroom. The sword is usually near the 'Beware of Gnomes' sign.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Of course! Everywhere there are gnomes, there is treasure. Classic game logic.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Now, if only Sparky would take a nap...</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Or if you could bribe him with a shiny coin?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm, worth a try! If I had any shiny coins left after buying these magic boots he ate!</p>
