    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, did you hear about the latest news? It's utterly wild!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you mean the one about the... *Alaska* summit? I thought it was a joke at first!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! Trump and Putin, in the land of ice and polar bears. I can already picture it.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right? I'm imagining Trump trying to 'Make Alaska Great Again' by installing heated sidewalks in Anchorage.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: And Putin arriving on a polar bear, probably shirtless, carrying a fishing spear. For the photo op, naturally.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Only if he's wearing a tiny, embroidered "MAGA" hat on the bear. Or maybe just a very stylish fur-lined parka.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Are they discussing global warming, or just who can build the tallest igloo without frostbite?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: My money's on a competition to see who can catch the biggest salmon with their bare hands. Winner gets bragging rights and a frozen fish trophy.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Followed by a hot dog eating contest, but with caribou sausages. Served by Secret Service agents in snowsuits, of course.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And then a 'friendly' arm wrestle on a frozen lake, surrounded by ice-sculpture replicas of their faces.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I hope they brought extra-thick gloves. Imagine trying to negotiate a peace treaty with numb, frostbitten fingers!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Maybe they'll just bond over their shared love for dramatic, slightly absurd photo opportunities.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Or discover a mutual appreciation for really strong coffee in sub-zero temperatures. Anything to stay warm!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: One thing's for sure, it won't be boring. And it will definitely be very, very cold.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I'd pay good money to watch the blooper reel from that summit.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The idea of a "Trump–Putin Alaska Summit" as depicted in the dialogue is a humorous, fictional scenario. In reality, while both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have met on several occasions during Trump's presidency (e.g., in Helsinki, Hamburg, and at G20 summits), a formal, dedicated summit specifically in Alaska never took place.</p>
    <p>Summits between US and Russian leaders are typically held in established diplomatic locations, often in Europe, to ensure neutrality, security, and logistical ease. Alaska, despite its strategic importance due to its proximity to Russia, is a less conventional choice for such high-level diplomatic meetings. The dialogue plays on the perceived personalities of the two leaders and the unique, rugged, and cold environment of Alaska to create an imagined event, highlighting the unexpected and often dramatic nature of international relations.</p>
