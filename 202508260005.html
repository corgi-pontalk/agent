        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, Bob, you will NOT believe the morning I've had!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Whoa, Alice, what's got you so wired? Did your coffee machine rebel again?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Worse! I just read about the EU's new AI Regulation, and now I'm convinced my smart fridge is plotting against me.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> (chuckles) Your fridge? Planning a coup with the toaster, perhaps? What specifically freaked you out?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's all these terms: 'high-risk AI systems,' 'prohibited practices,' 'conformity assessments.' It sounds like they're preparing for a robot uprising!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Not quite, though I admit the legal jargon can sound a bit dramatic. It's actually meant to ensure AI is trustworthy and ethical.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ethical? So, my vacuum cleaner won't judge my messy living room anymore? Because that would be a relief.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> (laughs) Well, it's more about things like facial recognition, medical devices, or critical infrastructure. Systems that could really impact people's safety or fundamental rights.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> So, my AI-powered cat feeder is safe? It won't decide my cat needs a diet and refuse to dispense kibble?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Probably safe from <em>that</em> particular regulation. The idea is to have a robust framework for developers and deployers to follow.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A 'robust framework' for my AI cat feeder? Sounds like a lot of paperwork just to make sure Fluffy gets her breakfast on time.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Think of it as setting global standards. If the EU establishes strict rules, it can influence how AI is developed worldwide.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> So, essentially, the EU is telling the robots, 'Play nice or no data for you!' I can get behind that.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Exactly! It's a proactive step to mitigate risks and foster innovation, not to declare war on sentient toasters.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Okay, okay, I get it. No robot apocalypse... yet. But if my self-driving car ever winks at me, I'm calling you!</p>

    <div class="current-situation">
        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The European Union has taken a pioneering step by creating the world's first comprehensive law on Artificial Intelligence, known as the **AI Act**. This regulation aims to ensure that AI systems placed on the EU market and used within the EU are safe, ethical, and respect fundamental rights and democratic values.</p>
        <p>The AI Act employs a **risk-based approach**, categorizing AI systems into different levels: unacceptable risk (e.g., social scoring, real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces by law enforcement, with narrow exceptions), high-risk (e.g., AI in critical infrastructure, medical devices, employment, law enforcement, migration management), limited risk (e.g., chatbots requiring transparency), and minimal/no risk (most AI systems, like spam filters, which are largely unregulated).</p>
        <p>For high-risk systems, the Act imposes stringent requirements, including data quality, human oversight, transparency, and conformity assessments before they can be deployed. It also establishes new governance and enforcement structures, including an AI Office at the EU level. Passed by the European Parliament in March 2024 and officially adopted by the Council in May 2024, the AI Act will be phased in over the coming months and years, with certain prohibitions taking effect sooner than others. It is expected to set a global benchmark for AI regulation.</p>
