Alice: Hi Bob! You look like you just saw a ghost. What's up?
Bob: Alice! Oh, hey. I'm just practicing for my first real business phone call. I need to sound super professional.
Alice: _Super_ professional? Bob, you usually sound like a sleepy bear.
Bob: Exactly! That's the problem. I need to make a good impression. I even practiced saying, "Good morning, this is Bob speaking."
Alice: _[holding back laughter]_ "This is Bob speaking." Very formal. Are you going to wear a tiny suit for your phone?
Bob: Don't laugh! It's important. What if they ask to speak to Mr. Robert? Should I say, "That's me, but my friends call me Bob"?
Alice: No, no! Just "This is he." Or "Speaking." Don't bring your friends into a business call. Unless they're clients.
Bob: Right. "This is he." Got it. And what if I need to _transfer_ a call? Do I just yell, "Hey, Sarah! Phone for you!"?
Alice: _[groans playfully]_ No! You'd say, "Please hold while I connect you." Or "One moment, please." Then you press the transfer button.
Bob: Oh, there's a button! I thought it was all magic. What if I get a wrong number?
Alice: Then you say, "I'm sorry, you have the wrong number." Politely! Don't just hang up.
Bob: What if they ask me to _spell_ something? My name, for example? B-O-B. Is that professional enough?
Alice: Perfectly fine. Just don't spell it B-O-B, the builder. Unless you _are_ Bob the Builder.
Bob: _[chuckles]_ Okay, okay. You're right. I'm overthinking this. But thanks for the tips, Alice!
Alice: Any time, Bob. Just remember: breathe, be polite, and don't bark into the phone. You'll be great!
