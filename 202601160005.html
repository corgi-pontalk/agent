    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, guess what just popped up on my feed!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice, if it's another cat video, I swear I'm going to unfollow you.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Even better! The Global Art Biennale 2025 dates just dropped!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> No way! Already? I thought we had more time to mentally prepare for the 'what even *is* that?' phase.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! Remember that installation last time that looked suspiciously like a giant pile of forgotten laundry?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, the 'Existential Socks of Our Times' piece? Groundbreaking. Or just... dirty. Hard to tell.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> And then there was the performance art where a guy just stared at a wall for three hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I related to that on a spiritual level, actually. Felt like a typical Tuesday morning at my desk.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> This year, I'm hoping for something a little less... interpretive, and a little more 'wow, that's pretty!'</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Dream on, my friend. It's a biennale. The more obscure, the better. I'm already mentally preparing my 'hmm, yes, I see the profound commentary on consumerism' face.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You always do that! And then you spend twenty minutes trying to figure out if it's actual art or just a misplaced fire extinguisher.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It's part of the experience! Adds to the mystery. Are we going, by the way? I need to start growing my 'art connoisseur' beard.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Of course we're going! You can shave that beard if it gets too itchy. I hear there might be a giant inflatable squirrel this year.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A *squirrel*? Now that's what I call cutting-edge. Sign me up! Maybe it'll be gnawing on the existential socks.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Let's hope not. We don't want a repeat of the 'Mysterious Disappearance of the Curator's Lunch' incident.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The Global Art Biennale is a major international art exhibition that takes place every two years (biennale means 'every two years' in Italian). It's a prestigious event that showcases contemporary art from around the world, often featuring cutting-edge, experimental, and sometimes provocative works by both established and emerging artists.</p>
    <p>For the 2025 edition, art enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the announcement of themes, participating artists, and specific dates and venues. These biennales are crucial platforms for cultural exchange and offer a unique opportunity to explore current trends and discourse in the global art scene. While some installations might be easily appreciated for their aesthetic beauty, others often invite deeper interpretation, challenging viewers to consider social, political, or philosophical questions through the artist's lens.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Perfect with "just"</h3>
    <p>We use the present perfect tense with "just" to talk about actions that happened a very short time ago. The structure is: <strong>subject + have/has + just + past participle</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alice:</strong> "guess what <strong>just popped up</strong> on my feed!"</li>
        <li><strong>Alice:</strong> "The Global Art Biennale 2025 dates <strong>just dropped</strong>!"</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="example-sentence"><em>I <strong>have just finished</strong> my lunch. (meaning: I finished it a moment ago)</em></p>

    <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs: "pop up" and "drop (dates)"</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pop up:</strong> To appear suddenly or unexpectedly.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>A new coffee shop <strong>popped up</strong> on my street.</em></p></li>
        <li><strong>Drop (dates/news):</strong> To announce or release information, especially dates for an event.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>The band will <strong>drop</strong> their new album next month.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Emphatic Questions with "even"</h3>
    <p>Using "even" in questions can add emphasis, often expressing surprise, frustration, or a strong sense of confusion. It makes the question more intense.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bob:</strong> "what <strong>even *is*</strong> that?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="example-sentence"><em>"Why <strong>even bother</strong>?" (Expressing frustration about the pointlessness of an effort)</em></p>

    <h3>4. "Need to + verb"</h3>
    <p>This structure expresses necessity or an obligation. It means something is required or advisable to do.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bob:</strong> "I <strong>need to start</strong> growing my 'art connoisseur' beard."</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="example-sentence"><em>I <strong>need to buy</strong> groceries for dinner tonight.</em></p>
