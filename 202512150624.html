    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, have you thought much about the Winter Olympics in 2026? It feels like it's just around the corner!</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! You know me, I'm practically already polishing my imaginary bobsled! I hear Milan and Cortina are really <strong>gearing up for</strong> it.</p>
        <p>Alice: Polishing your imaginary bobsled? Bob, the only thing you polish is the remote control on your couch! But yes, Milan-Cortina. I heard the preparations are <strong>in full swing</strong>.</p>
        <p>Bob: Details, details. A man can dream, can't he? I'm just picturing myself nailing a triple axel... or maybe just gracefully falling into a snowdrift.</p>
        <p>Alice: More likely the latter! I saw some news about the venues. Apparently, there are quite a few projects <strong>under construction</strong>, and they're really pushing for sustainability.</p>
        <p>Bob: That's great to hear. I mean, we want epic games, but not at the expense of, you know, the actual winter. Imagine a Winter Olympics without snow!</p>
        <p>Alice: Right? Though it's Italy, so maybe they'll just bring in a giant snow machine. The <strong>anticipation is building</strong>, especially for the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, I'm already picturing the spectacle. Do you think they'll manage to <strong>pull off</strong> something even more amazing than Beijing or PyeongChang?</p>
        <p>Alice: They've got big shoes to fill, but Italians are known for their style, so I have high hopes. What sport are you most excited to watch?</p>
        <p>Bob: Curling, definitely curling! It's like strategic sweeping on ice. I <strong>wouldn't mind</strong> trying it, actually. It looks less... impactful on the bones than, say, ski jumping.</p>
        <p>Alice: True. I'm more into figure skating. All that grace and artistry. It makes me feel incredibly uncoordinated just watching it.</p>
        <p>Bob: Tell me about it. My figure skating routine would mostly involve flailing and then landing on my bottom. But seriously, it's <strong>going to be</strong> a huge event for Italy.</p>
        <p>Alice: Absolutely. And it's only two years away! I hope they <strong>manage to finish</strong> everything on time.</p>
        <p>Bob: Me too. Let's start saving up for some authentic Italian hot chocolate to enjoy while we watch, eh?</p>
        <p>Alice: Sounds like a plan, Bob! Just try not to break any imaginary bones before then.</p>
        <p>Bob: No promises, Alice, no promises!</p>
