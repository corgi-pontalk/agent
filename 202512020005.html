    <h2>Dialogue</h2>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, have you been following all the buzz about the Paris Olympics?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Of course! My social media feed is basically 90% croissant emojis and 10% athletic prowess.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Right? But beyond the fancy opening ceremony and the medals, I'm actually curious about the 'legacy' stuff.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Legacy? You mean like, are we all suddenly going to start wearing berets and saying 'Ooh la la' after it's over?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, not quite. More like the environmental improvements, new infrastructure, social benefits, that sort of thing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, the serious stuff. Well, I did read something about the Seine. They're supposedly making it swimmable again, aren't they?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! Imagine, swimming in the Seine! That feels like something straight out of a really old movie, or a very brave tourist's bucket list.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And they're actually going to use it for Olympic events, right? Triathlon and open water swimming. Talk about a glow-up for a river!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Totally! It's supposed to be much cleaner. They've invested a *lot* in purification systems. Hopefully, it lasts beyond the games.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: True. I'd be less keen on a 'legacy' of just sparkling water for a month and then back to... whatever was in it before.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: And what about the urban regeneration? I heard they built a whole new aquatic centre and the Olympic Village is going to be converted into housing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Yep, affordable housing, apparently. That's a pretty tangible benefit, beats having empty stadiums gathering dust.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Definitely. Though I imagine the residents will get some pretty intense flashbacks every four years when the torch relay passes by.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Imagine trying to explain to your kids, 'Yes, darling, mommy used to train for the decathlon right where our kitchen is now.' Olympic glory in your living room!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Well, let's hope the legacy is truly sparkling and sustainable, not just a fleeting splash. Cheers to cleaner water and affordable homes, Bob!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hear, hear, Alice! Now, where's my baguette? All this talk of Paris has made me hungry.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games aim to leave a significant and positive legacy for the city and its inhabitants, extending far beyond the athletic competitions. A central focus is environmental sustainability, with ambitious efforts to make these the "greenest" games yet.</p>
    <p>One of the most ambitious projects is the revitalization of the River Seine, making parts of it swimmable for the first time in over a century. This involves substantial investment in water purification infrastructure, with the goal of improving public health and providing new recreational spaces. Several Olympic events, like triathlon and open water swimming, are planned to take place directly in the Seine, symbolizing this transformation.</p>
    <p>Urban regeneration is another key pillar. The Olympic Village in Saint-Denis, built with sustainable principles, is designed to be converted into approximately 2,800 homes (including affordable housing) and offices after the Games, addressing local housing needs. New sports facilities, such as the Olympic Aquatic Centre, will also be opened for public use post-Games.</p>
    <p>Beyond infrastructure, the legacy also targets social inclusion, promoting sports participation among all age groups and improving accessibility for people with disabilities. While economic benefits are anticipated through tourism and job creation, the long-term goal is to integrate these developments seamlessly into the city's fabric, ensuring enduring benefits for the community rather than creating 'white elephants' (unused, expensive facilities).</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous</h3>
        <p><strong>Use:</strong> This tense is used for actions that started in the past and are still continuing up to the present moment, or for actions that have recently stopped but have a clear present result.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <em>have/has + been + verb-ing</em></p>
        <p><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "Alice: Hey Bob, <span class="example-sentence">have you been following</span> all the buzz about the Paris Olympics?" (She's asking if his continuous action of following started in the past and is still ongoing.)</p>
        <p><strong>Another example:</strong> "I <span class="example-sentence">have been studying</span> English for two hours."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Future Tenses: 'Will' vs. 'Going to'</h3>
        <p>These two forms are used to talk about the future, but they often have slightly different nuances.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>'Will'</strong>:
                <p><strong>Use:</strong> Used for predictions (often based on opinion), spontaneous decisions made at the moment of speaking, promises, offers, and requests.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I think it <span class="example-sentence">will rain</span> tomorrow." (Prediction)</p>
                <p><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> (Implied) "I'd be less keen on a 'legacy'... if it <span class="example-sentence">goes back</span>..." (Alice is speculating about a future event. Though not direct 'will', it sets up a future context).</p></li>
            <li><strong>'Going to'</strong>:
                <p><strong>Use:</strong> Used for plans and intentions that have already been decided before the moment of speaking, or for predictions based on current evidence.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "We <span class="example-sentence">are going to visit</span> Paris next summer. We already bought the tickets!" (A definite plan)</p>
                <p><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "The Olympic Village <span class="example-sentence">is going to be converted</span> into housing." (This is a plan already in place.)</p>
                <p><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "They're actually <span class="example-sentence">going to use</span> it for Olympic events, right?" (Referring to a known plan.)</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Conditional Sentences (Type 1)</h3>
        <p><strong>Use:</strong> Type 1 conditionals are used to express real or very probable situations in the future. They talk about a possible condition and its likely result.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <em>If + present simple, subject + will + base verb</em> (or another modal verb like 'can', 'may', 'should').</p>
        <p><strong>Example from dialogue (implied):</strong> "Hopefully, it lasts beyond the games." (Meaning: If it lasts beyond the games, then it will be a true legacy.)</p>
        <p><strong>Direct example:</strong> "If they <span class="example-sentence">clean up</span> the Seine, people <span class="example-sentence">will swim</span> in it."</p>
        <p><strong>Another example:</strong> "If it <span class="example-sentence">rains</span> tomorrow, we <span class="example-sentence">will stay</span> home."</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous</h3>
        <p><strong>Use:</strong> This tense is used for actions that started in the past and are still continuing up to the present moment, or for actions that have recently stopped but have a clear present result.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <em>have/has + been + verb-ing</em></p>
        <p><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "Alice: Hey Bob, <span class="example-sentence">have you been following</span> all the buzz about the Paris Olympics?" (She's asking if his continuous action of following started in the past and is still ongoing.)</p>
        <p><strong>Another example:</strong> "I <span class="example-sentence">have been studying</span> English for two hours."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Future Tenses: 'Will' vs. 'Going to'</h3>
        <p>These two forms are used to talk about the future, but they often have slightly different nuances.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>'Will'</strong>:
                <p><strong>Use:</strong> Used for predictions (often based on opinion), spontaneous decisions made at the moment of speaking, promises, offers, and requests.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I think it <span class="example-sentence">will rain</span> tomorrow." (Prediction)</p>
                <p><strong>Example from dialogue (implied):</strong> "I'd be less keen on a 'legacy'... if it <span class="example-sentence">goes back</span>..." (Alice is speculating about a future event. Though not direct 'will', it sets up a future context, often interchangeable with 'will' in predictions).</p></li>
            <li><strong>'Going to'</strong>:
                <p><strong>Use:</strong> Used for plans and intentions that have already been decided before the moment of speaking, or for predictions based on current evidence.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> "We <span class="example-phrase">are going to visit</span> Paris next summer. We already bought the tickets!" (A definite plan)</p>
                <p><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "The Olympic Village <span class="example-sentence">is going to be converted</span> into housing." (This is a plan already in place.)</p>
                <p><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "They're actually <span class="example-sentence">going to use</span> it for Olympic events, right?" (Referring to a known plan.)</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Conditional Sentences (Type 1)</h3>
        <p><strong>Use:</strong> Type 1 conditionals are used to express real or very probable situations in the future. They talk about a possible condition and its likely result.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <em>If + present simple, subject + will + base verb</em> (or another modal verb like 'can', 'may', 'should').</p>
        <p><strong>Example from dialogue (implied):</strong> "Hopefully, it lasts beyond the games." (Meaning: If it lasts beyond the games, then it will be a true legacy.)</p>
        <p><strong>Direct example:</strong> "If they <span class="example-sentence">clean up</span> the Seine, people <span class="example-sentence">will swim</span> in it."</p>
        <p><strong>Another example:</strong> "If it <span class="example-sentence">rains</span> tomorrow, we <span class="example-sentence">will stay</span> home."</p>
