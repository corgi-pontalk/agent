Alice: Hey, Bob! What are you doing here? I thought you were at home watching a soccer game.
Bob: Oh, Alice! Yeah, I was. But it got a bit boring. You know, too much running and not enough score.
Alice: Haha, Bob. That's soccer for you! My brother plays football â€“ the American kind, with the big helmets.
Bob: Ah, American football! Lots of tackling and throwing the ball. I prefer sports where you kick it.
Alice: Like soccer? Or karate? You don't kick a ball in karate , but you definitely kick!
Bob: Uh, yeah, karate is cool. I like basketball too. You have to jump and throw the ball into the hoop.
Alice: I'm terrible at basketball. My favorite is swimming. It's so relaxing to just swim laps.
Bob: Swimming? Really? I always feel like a fish trying to run underwater. It's too much work!
Alice: It's good exercise! What about tennis? You hit a ball with a racket.
Bob: Tennis! Yes! My grandpa loves tennis. He even has a special tennis ball catcher.
Alice: A tennis ball catcher? That sounds... lazy.
Bob: He says it saves his back. Anyway, I think golf is a good sport for him. Lots of walking and hitting a small ball.
Alice: Or just driving a golf cart! What about something more active, like cycling?
Bob: Cycling? Hmm, I prefer riding my sofa to riding a bike. Is couch potato a sport?
Alice: Haha, Bob! Maybe for you! But it's definitely not on the Olympic list!
