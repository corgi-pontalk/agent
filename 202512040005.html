        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, did you catch the Women's World Cup final? It was absolutely electric!</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, I almost did, but I ended up watching a documentary about competitive napping. My bad! But I saw highlights – looked intense!</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Competitive napping? You're missing out! The atmosphere, the skill... it was next level. Women's soccer is really <span class="key-phrase">taking off</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Yeah, I've noticed. My social media feed is suddenly full of incredible goals and celebrations. It's <span class="key-phrase">quite the phenomenon</span>, isn't it?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Absolutely! Attendance records are being smashed, TV viewership is soaring. It's not just a niche sport anymore.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: I remember when people <span class="grammar-point">used to say</span> women's sports weren't as exciting. Clearly, they <span class="key-phrase">ate their words</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: They definitely did! The athleticism, the tactical play, the sheer passion – it's all there. Plus, the drama!</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: So, are you telling me I should swap my competitive napping for a season ticket to the NWSL?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, you absolutely should! Or at least tune in more often. You might even <span class="key-phrase">become a convert</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm, a convert, eh? Are we talking about world-class talent, or just... really good?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: We're talking world-class, my friend! These athletes are <span class="key-phrase">at the top of their game</span>. Seriously, the technical ability is mind-blowing.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, okay, you've convinced me. Next big match, you're dragging me to watch it. No napping documentaries allowed!</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Deal! You won't regret it. Prepare to be amazed. And maybe buy a scarf.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: A scarf? Is there a particular team I should be <span class="key-phrase">rooting for</span>?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, you're in deep now! Let me tell you about the Portland Thorns...</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. The Present Perfect Tense</h3>
        <p>The Present Perfect tense (<span class="grammar-point">has/have + past participle</span>) is used to describe actions that started in the past and continue into the present, or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past but have a clear relevance to the present.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="example-sentence">"I <span class="grammar-point">have noticed</span>."</span> (Bob started noticing in the past and continues to notice now.)</li>
            <li><span class="example-sentence">"You've <span class="grammar-point">convinced</span> me."</span> (The act of convincing happened in the past, but the result – Bob being convinced – is relevant now.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. "Used to" for Past Habits or States</h3>
        <p>We use <span class="grammar-point">"used to" + base form of the verb</span> to talk about habits, states, or situations that were true or happened regularly in the past but do not happen now.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="example-sentence">"I remember when people <span class="grammar-point">used to say</span> women's sports weren't as exciting."</span> (This implies that people said this in the past, but they don't say it anymore, or their opinion has changed.)</li>
            <li>It cannot be used for a single past event.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and an adverb or a preposition (or both) that, when used together, often have a meaning different from the original verb. They are very common in informal English.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">"taking off"</span> (verb "take" + adverb "off"): becoming popular/successful.</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">"tune in"</span> (verb "tune" + preposition "in"): to watch or listen to a broadcast.</li>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">"rooting for"</span> (verb "root" + preposition "for"): to support a team/person.</li>
        </ul>
