        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, you look so happy today! What happened?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice! Guess what? I went to the zoo and the aquarium yesterday!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Oh, wow! That sounds fun! What did you see?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: You won't believe it! At the zoo, there was a penguin that tripped over its own feet! It was so funny!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: (Laughing) A clumsy penguin? That's hilarious! Was it okay?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Yes, totally fine! It just waddled away like nothing happened. And the lions? They were sleeping the whole time. Super lazy!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Typical lions! And the aquarium? Did you see any cool fish?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Absolutely! My favorite part was the giant shark tank. The sharks were huge! And there were little colorful fish, too.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Wow, sharks are a bit scary for me. Did you see any sea turtles?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Yes! There was a really old, big sea turtle. It looked so peaceful. I also saw some jellyfish, they looked like dancing lights.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Dancing lights, that's a good description! It sounds like you had a great time.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: I definitely did! You should go sometime, Alice. It's really fun to see all the animals.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Maybe I will! What about the food there? Was it expensive?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: A little, but I brought my own sandwich. Smart, right?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Very smart, Bob! I'll remember that. Thanks for telling me!</p>

        <h2>Current Situation: Zoos & Aquariums Today</h2>
        <p>Zoos and aquariums around the world are changing. In the past, they were mostly for entertainment. Today, their main goals are animal conservation, education, and research. Many work hard to protect endangered species and educate visitors about wildlife and environmental issues. They try to create natural habitats for the animals. However, there are ongoing discussions about animal welfare and the ethics of keeping animals in captivity. Many modern facilities prioritize animal well-being and contribute significantly to global conservation efforts.</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Simple Past Tense for Describing Past Events</h3>
        <p>We use the Simple Past tense to talk about actions that happened at a specific time in the past and are now finished.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regular verbs</b> usually end with -ed (e.g., <em>walked, played, watched</em>).</li>
            <li><b>Irregular verbs</b> change their form (e.g., <em>go - went, see - saw, have - had, be - was/were</em>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: <em>"I <b>went</b> to the zoo yesterday!"</em> (go -> went)</p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: <em>"there <b>was</b> a penguin that <b>tripped</b>..."</em> (be -> was, trip -> tripped)</p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>She <b>watched</b> a movie last night.</em></p>

        <h3>2. "There was / There were" for Existence in the Past</h3>
        <p>We use "there was" for singular nouns and "there were" for plural nouns to say that something existed in a place in the past.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>There was</b> + singular noun (e.g., <em>a penguin, a shark</em>)</li>
            <li><b>There were</b> + plural noun (e.g., <em>lions, colorful fish</em>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: <em>"<b>there was</b> a penguin..."</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: <em>"<b>there were</b> little colorful fish..."</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>There was a big tree in the garden. There were many birds on the tree.</em></p>

        <h3>3. Asking "What did you see?" (Past Tense Questions)</h3>
        <p>To ask about specific things someone saw or did in the past, we often use "What did you...?"</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What did you see?</b> (You saw something)</li>
            <li><b>What did you do?</b> (You did something)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: <em>"What did you see?"</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>What did you eat for lunch yesterday?</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: <em>What did you like the most?</em></p>
