    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, what are you looking at so intently? Are you trying to find a hidden treasure?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, hi Alice! Almost! I'm trying to draw this really cool... thing. But I'm completely stuck on its head!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Let me see! Is it a monster? A secret alien pet?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Kind of! It's supposed to be a robot, but his head looks like a... a... flat, giant button.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You mean a <strong>circle</strong>? Like a big, round pizza!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Yes! A pizza head! Perfect! And his body is like a big, solid book.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Ah, a <strong>rectangle</strong>! Good, that's easy to draw. Like a door or a tall building.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: And his arms are like two long rulers.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: More <strong>rectangles</strong>! You're surprisingly good at finding shapes, Bob!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: But his feet... they're pointy, like a slice of pie.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A <strong>triangle</strong>! So, a robot with a pizza head, a book body, ruler arms, and pie feet? He sounds delicious!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! And his buttons are tiny little... dice!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Those are <strong>squares</strong>, my friend! This robot is a shape party! What about his eyes?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Uh, two more tiny circles for eyes, like small candies. He needs a nose, though. Hmm, what about a tiny, stretched-out circle?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: An <strong>oval</strong>! Excellent! You're practically a shape architect, Bob! Or a shape chef, if we keep talking about food.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I think I prefer "shape chef." Now, where's my pizza-head robot's chef hat?</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Shapes are fundamental building blocks of everything we see and interact with daily! From the screen you're looking at right now (a <strong>rectangle</strong>) to the wheels on a car (a <strong>circle</strong>), and even a slice of pizza (a <strong>triangle</strong>), shapes help us describe the world around us. A building often has <strong>square</strong> windows, and an egg is a perfect <strong>oval</strong>. Understanding basic shapes is not only useful for drawing and art but also for understanding signs, maps, and the design of everyday objects. They are a universal language that helps us organize and make sense of our visual environment.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>The verb "To be" (is/are) for Description</h3>
            <p>We use "is" for singular nouns and "are" for plural nouns to describe or identify objects and their shapes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Singular: "His head <strong>is</strong> a <strong>circle</strong>." (One head, one circle)</li>
                <li>Plural: "His arms <strong>are</strong> <strong>rectangles</strong>." (Two arms, multiple rectangles)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Using "like" for Comparison</h3>
            <p>When you want to say that something is similar to something else, you can use "like a/an".</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"His head looks <strong>like a pizza</strong>." (The head is similar to a pizza)</li>
                <li>"His feet are <strong>like a slice of pie</strong>." (The feet resemble a slice of pie)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Asking Basic Questions (What / Is it)</h3>
            <p>These are common ways to ask about objects or actions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"What are you looking at?"</strong> (Asking about an object someone is observing)</li>
                <li><strong>"Is it a monster?"</strong> (Asking for confirmation about the identity of something)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Articles "a" and "an"</h3>
            <p>"A" and "an" are used before singular nouns. "An" is used before a word that starts with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"a <strong>c</strong>ircle", "a <strong>r</strong>ectangle" (consonant sound)</li>
                <li>"an <strong>o</strong>val", "an <strong>a</strong>pple" (vowel sound)</li>
