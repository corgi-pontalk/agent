    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Hey, Bob! You look like you just saw a ghost, or maybe you won the lottery?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Oh, Alice, it's even more dramatic! The Cricket World Cup has gone absolutely bonkers!</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Bonkers? What happened now? Did someone drop the trophy before the final again?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Worse! Much, much worse! Yesterday, the Mongoose team – the absolute underdogs – actually <em>beat</em> the mighty Lions! Nobody saw it coming.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Wait, the Mongoose team? Are they like, actual mongooses? Because that would be quite a spectacle.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> (chuckles) No, no, Alice. It’s just their nickname. But they played like they had nine lives! The Lions were completely <strong>caught off guard</strong>. I was literally <strong>on the edge of my seat</strong> the whole time.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> "On the edge of your seat." So you didn't actually fall off, then? Good. My heart rate can't handle too much excitement.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> You're cracking jokes, but this is a <strong>seismic shift</strong>! Everyone thought the Lions were a <strong>shoo-in</strong> for the semi-finals. Now, their spot is looking shaky.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> A 'shoo-in'? Is that like a shoe that just walks right in?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> (sighs dramatically) It means they were a guaranteed winner! Now, this Mongoose upset has completely opened up the group stage. It's a proper <strong>dark horse</strong> story unfolding.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> "Dark horse." So, a mysterious, fast horse that no one expected? I'm getting a crash course in cricket metaphors here.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Precisely! They've <strong>come out of nowhere</strong> and are now making a real run for the <strong>knockout stages</strong>. It’s thrilling!</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> I guess I should start <strong>keeping tabs on</strong> it then. You make it sound quite exciting, even for a non-cricket fan like me.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> You absolutely should! The Cheetahs are playing the Eagles next, and that's going to be another <strong>nail-biter</strong>. Want to come over and watch? I'll even explain the rules as we go.</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> Hmm, a nail-biter and cricket rules? Maybe. I'll bring the snacks, you bring the commentary, Bob. Deal?</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</strong> Deal! But no laughing at my passionate outbursts!</p>
    <p><strong class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</strong> No promises, Bob!</p>
