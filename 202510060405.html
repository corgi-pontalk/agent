        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, Bob, I really need to pop into this pharmacy for a second.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! Are you okay? What's wrong? Do you have a fever? Is it serious?! You look... fine, actually. But maybe it's an invisible sickness!</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> (Laughing) No, Bob, I'm perfectly fine! I just ran out of my special 'happy feet' cream. My feet get so tired after work.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Happy feet cream? Is that like... medicine for sad feet? Do they sing? Or dance?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> It just makes them feel good! It's a special cooling cream. Excuse me, do you have any foot cream?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Pharmacist:</span> (Walks over) Hello! Yes, we have many kinds. Are you looking for something specific, like a cooling cream or a moisturizer?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Yes, a cooling cream, please. Something for tired feet.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Pharmacist:</span> I see. We have this one. It's very popular. It has mint and eucalyptus. Would you like to try it?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, perfect! That sounds lovely. How much is it?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Pharmacist:</span> It's 9 dollars and 50 cents.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Wow, 9 dollars for happy feet! Mine are usually happy for free. Maybe I should get some. Do they make your whole body happy?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly) Just the feet, Bob. Just the feet. Yes, I'll take it, please.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Pharmacist:</span> Great! Anything else today?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> No, thank you! That's all.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> So, Alice, after this, are we going to see your feet do a little happy dance?</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Alice and Bob are friends who are visiting a pharmacy. Alice needs to buy a specific item: a special cream for her tired feet. Bob is with her and is a bit humorous and dramatic, making jokes and asking silly questions about the foot cream. The pharmacist helps Alice find the right product and tells her the price. Alice buys the cream, and Bob continues to joke about her "happy feet."</p>

        <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I need to...</strong> - Used to say something is necessary or important for you to do.

            <li><strong>Are you okay?</strong> - A common way to ask if someone is feeling well.
                <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>You look a little pale. Are you okay?</em></span></li>
            <li><strong>I ran out of...</strong> - Means you used all of something and now have none left.
                <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>Oh no, I ran out of coffee!</em></span></li>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Using "I need..."</h3>
        <p>We use <strong>"I need"</strong> to express something that is necessary for you. It can be followed by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>noun</strong>: <em>I need a foot cream.</em> (What do you need?)</li>
            <li>The word <strong>"to" + a verb</strong>: <em>I need to buy a foot cream.</em> (What do you need to do?)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the dialogue, Alice says: "I <strong>need to pop</strong> into this pharmacy." and "I really <strong>need</strong> my special 'happy feet' cream."</p>

        <h3>2. Asking "Do you have...?" and "How much is it?"</h3>
        <p>These are very important questions for shopping!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Do you have...?</strong>: Use this to ask if a shop sells a particular item.
                <br><em>Example: Do you have any pain relievers?</em></li>
            <li><strong>How much is it?</strong>: Use this to ask for the price of one item.
                <br><em>Example: How much is this apple?</em></li>
            <li><strong>How much are they?</strong>: Use this to ask for the price of multiple items.
                <br><em>Example: How much are these shoes?</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the dialogue, Alice asks: "<strong>Do you have</strong> any foot cream?" and "<strong>How much is it?</strong>"</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Alice and Bob are friends who are visiting a pharmacy. Alice needs to buy a specific item: a special cream for her tired feet. Bob is with her and is a bit humorous and dramatic, making jokes and asking silly questions about the foot cream. The pharmacist helps Alice find the right product and tells her the price. Alice buys the cream, and Bob continues to joke about her "happy feet."</p>

            <li>The word <strong>"to" + a verb</strong>: <em>I need to buy a foot cream.</em> (What do you need to do?)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the dialogue, Alice says: "I <strong>need to pop</strong> into this pharmacy." and "I really <strong>need</strong> my special 'happy feet' cream."</p>
