    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, you will not believe what I just read!</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice, what's got you all buzzed up this early? Did you finally figure out how to train your cat to do your taxes?</p>
        <p>Alice: Even better! We're talking about brain-computer interfaces! Like, actual mind-reading, controlling things with your thoughts!</p>
        <p>Bob: Woah, woah, slow down. Are we talking about science fiction or something that's actually happening outside of a lab with flashing neon signs and mad scientists?</p>
        <p>Alice: It's happening! There are new breakthroughs almost every week. Imagine, paralyzed people being able to type just by thinking. Or controlling a prosthetic arm as if it were their own!</p>
        <p>Bob: Okay, that part sounds genuinely incredible. But what about the 'mind-reading' part? Are they going to know if I'm thinking about skipping work to play video games?</p>
        <p>Alice: (chuckles) Not quite that advanced yet, thankfully! It's more about decoding intentions or motor commands, not your deepest desires. So your boss is safe... for now.</p>
        <p>Bob: Good, because my deepest desire right now is pizza. Could I order a pepperoni with my mind? Now <em>that</em> would be a game-changer.</p>
        <p>Alice: A pizza-ordering BCI? That's a million-dollar idea, Bob! Someone get on that! But seriously, the medical applications are astounding. Think about restoring sight or hearing.</p>
        <p>Bob: True, the medical potential is huge. But what's the catch? Is it like strapping a giant helmet to your head with wires everywhere?</p>
        <p>Alice: Well, some current devices are invasive, requiring surgery. But non-invasive ones are getting better. Imagine a headset that lets you interact with a computer just by thinking. No more clumsy keyboards!</p>
        <p>Bob: So, in a few years, I could be playing my favorite game just by staring at the screen, telepathically demanding headshots? My K/D ratio is about to skyrocket!</p>
        <p>Alice: Exactly! Though I suspect competitive gaming might get <em>a little</em> intense. But think about productivity! Writing essays, coding, even just replying to emails, all at the speed of thought.</p>
        <p>Bob: Okay, you've convinced me. This BCI stuff is pretty mind-blowing. Let's just hope they don't accidentally link our brains to reality TV shows.</p>
        <p>Alice: (shudders) Now <em>that</em> would be a true horror story! Stick to the productivity and pizza, Bob. Stick to the productivity and pizza.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are a rapidly evolving field focusing on direct communication pathways between the brain's electrical activity and an external device. Recent advancements have pushed BCIs beyond the realm of pure science fiction into practical applications. Medically, they are offering new hope for individuals with paralysis, enabling them to control prosthetic limbs, communicate via text, or operate wheelchairs using only their thoughts. There's significant research into restoring sensory functions like sight and hearing. While some advanced BCIs still require invasive surgery to implant electrodes, non-invasive technologies, often using headsets, are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Beyond medicine, potential future applications include enhanced gaming, improved productivity by controlling computers directly with thoughts, and even general human augmentation. Challenges remain in terms of precision, ethical considerations, and making the technology widely accessible and safe.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Present Perfect Tense for Recent Events with Current Relevance</h3>
        <p>The Present Perfect tense (<strong>have/has + past participle</strong>) is used to talk about actions or states that happened at an unspecified time before now, or actions that started in the past and continue to the present. It often emphasizes the result or current impact of a past event.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example 1 (Dialogue):</strong> "what's got you all buzzed up this early?" (short for "what <strong>has</strong> got you...")<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> This implies that something recently happened that caused Alice to be excited, and she is still excited now.</li>
            <li><strong>Example 2 (Dialogue):</strong> "Okay, you've convinced me." (short for "you <strong>have</strong> convinced me")<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> Bob is referring to Alice's arguments that just happened, and the result is that he is now convinced.</li>
            <li><strong>Example (General):</strong> "There <strong>have been</strong> new breakthroughs almost every week."<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> This indicates that breakthroughs started happening in the past and continue to occur up to the present.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Modal Verbs: "Could," "Would," and "Might"</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs add extra meaning to the main verb, expressing possibility, ability, permission, obligation, and more. Here, we focus on their use for possibility, hypothetical situations, and predictions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Could:</strong> Expresses possibility or ability.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example (Possibility):</strong> "I *could* be playing my favorite game just by staring..." (This suggests a future possibility Alice is imagining).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example (Ability in hypothetical):</strong> "Could I order a pepperoni with my mind?" (Bob is asking about the *ability* to do something hypothetically).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Would:</strong> Expresses hypothetical situations or conditions, or refers to future actions from a past perspective.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example (Hypothetical Result):</strong> "Now <em>that</em> *would* be a game-changer." (If Bob *could* order pizza with his mind, the *result* *would* be a game-changer).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example (Hypothetical):</strong> "Now <em>that</em> *would* be a true horror story!" (If brains *were* linked to reality TV, that *would* be the result).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Might:</strong> Expresses a weaker possibility or uncertainty.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> "competitive gaming *might* get <em>a little</em> intense." (Alice thinks it's possible, but not certain, that gaming will get intense).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Gerunds (-ing forms) as Nouns</h3>
        <p>A gerund is the -ing form of a verb that functions as a noun. It can be the subject of a sentence, an object of a verb, or follow a preposition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example 1 (Dialogue - after preposition 'by'):</strong> "paralyzed people being able to type just <strong>by thinking</strong>."<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> 'thinking' here is a gerund, acting as the object of the preposition 'by', indicating the method.</li>
            <li><strong>Example 2 (Dialogue - object of 'imagine'):</strong> "Imagine, paralyzed people <strong>being</strong> able to type..."<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> 'being' is a gerund used as the object of the verb 'imagine'.</li>
            <li><strong>Example 3 (Dialogue - subject):</strong> "<strong>Writing</strong> essays, <strong>coding</strong>, even just <strong>replying</strong> to emails, all at the speed of thought."<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> 'Writing,' 'coding,' and 'replying' are gerunds acting as subjects of the implied sentence "These actions would be at the speed of thought."</li>
            <li><strong>Example (General):</strong> "<strong>Playing</strong> video games with your mind sounds amazing."<br>
                <em>Explanation:</em> 'Playing' is the subject of the sentence.</li>
        </ul>
