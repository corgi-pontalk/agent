            <h2>Dialogue</h2>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey, Bob! What are you doing here? I thought you were at home watching a <strong>soccer</strong> game.</p>
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, Alice! Yeah, I was. But it got a bit boring. You know, too much <strong>running</strong> and not enough <strong>score</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, Bob. That's <strong>soccer</strong> for you! My brother plays <strong>football</strong> – the American kind, with the big helmets.</p>
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Ah, <strong>American football</strong>! Lots of <strong>tackling</strong> and <strong>throwing</strong> the ball. I prefer sports where you <strong>kick</strong> it.</p>
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Like <strong>soccer</strong>? Or <strong>karate</strong>? You don't kick a ball in <strong>karate</strong>, but you definitely <strong>kick</strong>!</p>
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Uh, yeah, <strong>karate</strong> is cool. I like <strong>basketball</strong> too. You have to <strong>jump</strong> and <strong>throw</strong> the ball into the <strong>hoop</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I'm terrible at <strong>basketball</strong>. My favorite is <strong>swimming</strong>. It's so relaxing to just <strong>swim</strong> laps.</p>
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> <strong>Swimming</strong>? Really? I always feel like a fish trying to <strong>run</strong> underwater. It's too much <strong>work</strong>!</p>
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's good <strong>exercise</strong>! What about <strong>tennis</strong>? You <strong>hit</strong> a ball with a <strong>racket</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> <strong>Tennis</strong>! Yes! My grandpa loves <strong>tennis</strong>. He even has a special <strong>tennis ball</strong> catcher.</p>
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A <strong>tennis ball</strong> catcher? That sounds... lazy.</p>
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> He says it saves his back. Anyway, I think <strong>golf</strong> is a good sport for him. Lots of <strong>walking</strong> and <strong>hitting</strong> a small ball.</p>
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Or just driving a <strong>golf</strong> cart! What about something more active, like <strong>cycling</strong>?</p>
                <p><strong>Bob:</strong> <strong>Cycling</strong>? Hmm, I prefer <strong>riding</strong> my sofa to <strong>riding</strong> a bike. Is <strong>couch potato</strong> a sport?</p>
                <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, Bob! Maybe for you! But it's definitely not on the Olympic list!</p>
