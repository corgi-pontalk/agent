Alice: Bob, what in the world are you eating?
Bob: Alice! Oh, this? Just my experimental lunch.
Alice: "Experimental"? It looks like a sushi burrito exploded into a taco.
Bob: Precisely! It's a 'Sushirrito Loco' – Korean BBQ short ribs, kimchi, avocado, wrapped in a giant nori sheet, then in a crispy tortilla. Mind- blowing, right?
Alice: You're serious? That sounds... either genius or gastronomically criminal.
Bob: That's the beauty of global cuisine fusion trends! Chefs are going wild. Remember that Ethiopian-Italian place?
Alice: Oh, the 'Injera Lasagna'? My taste buds are still trying to process that one. The berbere spice with ricotta was... an experience.
Bob: Exactly! It's all about breaking boundaries. I saw a place doing 'Banh Mi Pizza' the other day.
Alice: No way! Is nothing sacred anymore? French baguette, Vietnamese fillings, Italian crust?
Bob: Apparently not! And apparently, it's delicious. They use pickled daikon and carrots as toppings instead of pepperoni.
Alice: I'm torn between being intrigued and deeply disturbed. What's next, a 'Curry Croissant'?
Bob: Funnily enough, I actually saw a recipe for a 'Masala Croissant' last week. With a mango chutney glaze.
Alice: You are making this up! My brain is short-circuiting. Is it actually good, or just for Instagram likes?
Bob: Some are definitely for the 'gram', but many are genuinely innovative. It's pushing culinary limits. Think about how ramen burgers started.
Alice: Okay, I'll admit, the ramen burger _was_ surprisingly good. Fine, you've piqued my interest. Where can I get one of those 'Sushirrito Locos'?
Bob: I knew you'd come around! Come on, I'll take you to 'Fusion Frenzy Bites'. They also have 'Tandoori Tikka Tacos'!
