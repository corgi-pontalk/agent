    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, guess what I heard on the news this morning? My brain felt super global!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, Alice? Tell me! Was it about how my coffee machine is <em>globally</em> warming my kitchen?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, almost! It was about <span class="key-phrase">climate change</span>. They said the ice is melting! Like, really melting, not just my ice cream.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, <span class="key-phrase">climate change</span>! So that's why my socks are always wet when it rains? I thought it was just bad luck.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Well, it's a bit more than wet socks, Bob. It means the Earth's weather is getting a bit… confused. Hotter here, colder there.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Confused weather, I get that! My hair is like that some mornings. What about <span class="key-phrase">pollution</span>? Is that why the sky sometimes looks a bit… grey? Like my mood before coffee.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! <span class="key-phrase">Pollution</span> is when there's too much rubbish in the air or water. Like when I accidentally drop my entire snack bag in the ocean. Oops.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You dropped your snack bag in the ocean? Alice! That's a serious <span class="key-phrase">environmental issue</span>!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It was a very small snack bag! But yes, it’s an <span class="key-phrase">environmental issue</span>. And what about people not having enough food? What's that called?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, that's <span class="key-phrase">food insecurity</span>. My fridge sometimes suffers from that after a long weekend. But for people, it’s serious.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Right! And when lots of people move from one country to another, what's that big word?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: That's <span class="key-phrase">migration</span>! Like when all the birds fly south for winter, but with suitcases and passports.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ha! Good one. And what about when people don't have enough money or homes?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: That's <span class="key-phrase">poverty</span>, Alice. A very serious problem. It’s like not having any pizza money, but for your whole life.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Wow, these global issues are… surprisingly simple when you put them like that!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: They are! But they're big problems that need big solutions. Maybe we should start with my wet socks.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Agreed, Bob. Small steps!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Global issues are problems that affect people and the planet around the world. These are not just local problems but challenges that require cooperation from many countries to solve. For example, <span class="key-phrase">climate change</span> refers to the long-term shift in global weather patterns, leading to more extreme weather events. <span class="key-phrase">Pollution</span> is the introduction of harmful substances into the environment, damaging air, water, and land. <span class="key-phrase">Poverty</span> means a lack of money, food, and basic needs for a large number of people. <span class="key-phrase">Food insecurity</span> is when people do not have reliable access to enough affordable, nutritious food. Lastly, <span class="key-phrase">migration</span> is the movement of people from one place to another, often to find a better life or escape difficult situations. Understanding these terms helps us talk about important topics.</p>

        <li>
            <h3>The Present Simple Tense</h3>
            <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about facts, habits, and things that are generally true. Global issues are often discussed using this tense because they are ongoing facts.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "It <strong>means</strong> the Earth's weather is getting a bit… confused."</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: "Pollution <strong>is</strong> when there's too much rubbish..."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Using "Too much" and "Enough"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Too much</strong>: Means more than what is needed or good.</li>
                <li><strong>Enough</strong>: Means the right amount, or sufficient.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "Pollution is when there's <strong>too much</strong> rubbish in the air or water."</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "People don't have <strong>enough</strong> food."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Asking Questions for Information (Wh-questions)</h3>
            <p>We use "What...?" and "What about...?" to ask for information or to change the topic to something related.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "<strong>What about</strong> pollution?"</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "<strong>What's</strong> that called?"</p>
