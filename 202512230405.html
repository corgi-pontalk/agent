    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, how was your first day at the new office? Any fun stories, or just a mountain of paperwork?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, it was... an adventure! My <em>desk</em> is so small, I can barely fit my <em>coffee mug</em>. And the <em>chair</em>? It feels like it's plotting against my back!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Laughing) Oh no! Did you at least get a decent <em>computer setup</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: The <em>laptop</em> is fine, but the <em>monitor</em> is gargantuan! It's like watching a movie in IMAX. And the <em>keyboard</em>... it has '<em>sticky keys</em>.' I suspect a spilled soda from a previous employee.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Sticky keys already? Bob, you definitely need new <em>office supplies</em>. Maybe a fresh <em>pen</em> that doesn't explode when you write.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I did find a <em>stapler</em>, but it only had one <em>staple</em> left. One! For all my important <em>documents</em>! And it ran out of <em>paper</em> immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Giggles) Sounds like you're in an office comedy. Did you find the <em>printer</em> or the dreaded <em>photocopier</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: The printer just blinked "<em>out of toner</em>" at me like it was mocking my existence. And the photocopier? It <em>ate three sheets of paper</em>, then jammed! It clearly has a vendetta.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Welcome to the jungle, my friend! Any exciting <em>meetings</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, yes. We had one in the <em>meeting room</em>. It had a giant <em>whiteboard</em>, perfect for <em>brainstorming</em>... but zero <em>markers</em>. We just stared at it.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Shaking her head playfully) Classic! At least you're getting to know your new <em>colleagues</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: True. One of them, a true hero, actually managed to get the <em>coffee machine</em> working. He deserves a medal!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A <em>coffee machine hero</em>! That's a good sign, Bob. You'll navigate this office maze in no time.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I hope so! I just need more <em>paper</em>, a <em>stapler</em> that actually works, and maybe a <em>mouse</em> that doesn't jump across the screen by itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Don't worry, you'll <em>master office survival</em>. Just make sure you guard your good pens!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. The verb "to be" (is/are)</h3>
        <p>We use "is" for singular nouns (one thing) and "are" for plural nouns (more than one thing).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My <strong>desk <em>is</em></strong> small. (singular)</li>
            <li>The <strong>keys <em>are</em></strong> sticky. (plural)</li>
            <li>Alice and Bob <strong><em>are</em></strong> friends. (plural subject)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Simple Present Tense (for habits, facts, and routines)</h3>
        <p>We use the simple present tense to talk about things that are generally true or happen regularly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For most verbs, we add "-s" to the verb when the subject is he, she, or it (or a singular noun).</li>
            <li>My chair <strong><em>feels</em></strong> old. (It, singular noun)</li>
            <li>The photocopier always <strong><em>eats</em></strong> paper. (It, singular noun)</li>
            <li>I <strong><em>need</em></strong> more paper. (I, no -s)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Basic Articles (a/an/the)</h3>
        <p>Articles come before nouns. "A" and "an" are indefinite (not specific), "the" is definite (specific).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <strong>a</strong> before singular nouns that start with a consonant sound: <em>a desk, a stapler, a pen</em>.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>an</strong> before singular nouns that start with a vowel sound: <em>an adventure, an office</em>.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>the</strong> when you're talking about a specific item or something already known: <em>the printer, the coffee machine</em> (that specific one in the office).</li>
        </ul>
