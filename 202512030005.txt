Alice: Bob, have you seen the news about the 2026 World Cup preparations? It's already getting wild!
Bob: Alice! Wild? I thought it was still ages away. What's the latest drama?
Alice: Drama is an understatement! They're talking about flying between three different countries for group stages. My poor wallet is already crying.
Bob: Three countries? That's insane! Are they trying to turn us into professional jet-setters just to watch a match?
Alice: Exactly! Imagine trying to coordinate travel and accommodation for that. It'll be a logistical nightmare.
Bob: At least the stadiums are going to be massive. I heard some cities are practically rebuilding entire districts just for the tournament.
Alice: True, the infrastructure is going to be top-notch. But will the hot dogs still cost an arm and a leg? That's the real question.
Bob: Priorities, Alice, priorities! I'm more worried about finding a decent pint that isn't watered down stadium brew.
Alice: Oh, you and your pints! I'm just dreaming of seeing my favorite team play, ideally without having to mortgage my house for a flight.
Bob: Well, start saving now! Or maybe we just find a really comfy couch and a huge TV. Much less hassle.
Alice: That's the cynical Bob I know! But think of the atmosphere, the roar of the crowd, the... _glamorous_ cross-continental travel.
Bob: Okay, okay, you've almost got me with the atmosphere. But seriously, the host cities must be buzzing with activity already.
Alice: Absolutely! I saw a report about Dallas trying to outdo New York for the final. It's like a sibling rivalry on a grand scale.
Bob: Dallas vs. New York for the final? That's a match in itself! I hope they have enough taxi drivers.
Alice: And enough Wi-Fi for all the selfie-taking fans! It's going to be epic, one way or another.
Bob: Epic and expensive. But hey, it's the World Cup. Worth every penny, right?
Alice: Almost every penny, Bob. Almost.
