    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, what are you reading? You look very serious.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, hi Alice! Just a book about... <strong>cells</strong>. Did you know everything is made of cells?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Cells? Like batteries? So I'm full of tiny batteries?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Haha, not exactly! Not the power-your-remote kind. These are living cells. The <strong>building blocks of life</strong>!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Building blocks... So like tiny LEGOs that make up me? That sounds fragile!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! But super strong LEGOs. And you have billions of them. Like a giant LEGO city!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Billions? Wow. So, <strong>plants</strong> have cells too, right?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Yes! And plant cells are special. They do something called <strong>photosynthesis</strong>.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Photosynthesis? Sounds like a really long word for 'eating sunlight'.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Pretty much! They use sunlight, water, and CO2 to make food. And they <strong>give us oxygen</strong>!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, so plants are like our air-making factories? Thank you, plants!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! And we, <strong>animals</strong>, breathe that oxygen.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, animals are... things that move and eat other things?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Broadly, yes! From a tiny ant to a giant whale, they're all animals. And humans? Biologically, we're also part of the <strong>animal kingdom</strong>.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: My mom told me I was a princess, not an animal! This biology stuff is confusing.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, you can be a biological mammal <em>and</em> a princess! No conflict there. And inside every cell, there's <strong>DNA</strong>, like an <strong>instruction manual</strong>.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: DNA? Like the secret code of life?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You got it! It tells your cells what to do and how to build you. And all these living things, like plants and animals, they live together, <strong>part of an ecosystem</strong>.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So my cat, the tree in the garden, and even the tiny bugs are all part of an ecosystem?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Absolutely! Even you and me. We're all part of the big <strong>biological picture</strong>.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Wow. Biology is more interesting than I thought. So, you're saying I'm a walking, talking, princess-mammal ecosystem?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Pretty much! And you're made of billions of LEGO-like cells. Welcome to biology!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Biology is the study of life, and understanding its basics helps us comprehend the world around us. Even for beginners, learning terms like <strong>cells</strong>, <strong>plants</strong>, <strong>animals</strong>, and <strong>ecosystems</strong> helps us appreciate how our bodies work, where our food comes from, and why taking care of the environment is crucial. It's not just for scientists; it's about being aware of how everything is connected, from the smallest living unit to the vast planet.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. The Present Simple Tense</h3>
    <div class="note">
        We use the <strong>Present Simple</strong> to talk about facts, habits, and general truths.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Facts/General Truths:</strong>
            <p>Subject + Verb (base form) / Verb + -s/-es (for he/she/it)</p>
            <p>Example: Everything <strong>is</strong> made of cells. (Fact)</p>
            <p>Example: Plants <strong>give</strong> us oxygen. (General truth)</p>
            <p>Example: A plant cell <strong>has</strong> a cell wall. (Fact)</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Remember the -s/-es for he/she/it:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I / You / We / They <strong>read</strong>.</li>
                <li>He / She / It <strong>reads</strong>.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. The Verb "To Be"</h3>
    <div class="note">
        The verb "to be" is essential for talking about identity, descriptions, and existence.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Forms:</strong> am, is, are</li>
        <li><strong>Used for Identity:</strong>
            <p>Example: I <strong>am</strong> Alice. (Identity)</p>
            <p>Example: Cells <strong>are</strong> the building blocks. (Identity)</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Used for Description:</strong>
            <p>Example: Biology <strong>is</strong> interesting. (Description)</p>
            <p>Example: You <strong>are</strong> serious. (Description)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Countable and Uncountable Nouns</h3>
    <div class="note">
        Some nouns can be counted (e.g., one cell, two cells), while others cannot (e.g., oxygen, information).
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Countable Nouns:</strong>
            <p>These have singular and plural forms. You can use numbers with them.</p>
            <p>Example: one <strong>cell</strong>, two <strong>cells</strong>, many <strong>animals</strong>, a few <strong>plants</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Uncountable Nouns:</strong>
            <p>These usually do not have a plural form. You cannot use numbers directly with them. We use words like "some" or "much".</p>
            <p>Example: <strong>oxygen</strong> (not "three oxygens"), <strong>water</strong>, <strong>information</strong>, <strong>food</strong>.</p>
            <p>Example: Plants give us <strong>oxygen</strong>.</p>
        </li>
