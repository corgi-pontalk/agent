Alice: Bob, you won't believe what I just saw on Instagram!
Bob: Let me guess, another video of a cat playing the piano? Or did your favorite human influencer finally endorse something affordable?
Alice: Even crazier! It was an AI influencer. Like, a completely digital person, promoting designer clothes and luxury travel!
Bob: Wait, seriously? Not a CGI character from a movie, but a full-time 'person' with a follower count? That's next level weird.
Alice: Exactly! Her name's Lil Miquela. She has millions of followers. And she 'travels' to exotic places, 'wears' virtual outfits, and even 'eats' digital gourmet meals!
Bob: Digital gourmet meals? Does she ever have a bad hair day? Or get caught without perfect lighting? I bet she's always flawless.
Alice: Nope, she's eternally perfect. Never ages, never has a scandal. Just pristine, polished content, 24/7. It's almost... creepy.
Bob: Sounds exhausting to be that perfect, even if you're not real. But also, kind of genius from a marketing perspective. No drama, no public meltdowns.
Alice: Right? Just pure, unadulterated brand promotion. It makes you wonder if human influencers are becoming obsolete.
Bob: Don't be so dramatic, Alice! I mean, who would you rather get genuine advice from? A real person with real experiences, or a perfectly rendered avatar?
Alice: Fair point. But what if the AI influencers start having deep, philosophical conversations? Like, "My algorithms are feeling a bit existential today, fam."
Bob: Haha! I think we're safe for a while. Though, I did see one 'dating' another AI influencer. Their 'virtual romance' was oddly compelling.
Alice: Okay, now *that's* a storyline I'd follow! An AI love triangle! Forget reality TV, this is the future!
Bob: Absolutely. I'm just waiting for them to start campaigning for digital rights for AI beings. Imagine the protests!
Alice: Or demanding better Wi-Fi! Now that's a cause I can get behind, virtual or not.
