Alice : Bob, have you seen that new campaign for ocean cleanup? Leonardo DiCaprio just posted about it with a picture of himself looking very thoughtful next to a single plastic bottle. Bob : Oh, Alice! I saw that! I swear, Leo could make watching paint dry look like a profound philosophical journey. He's practically the patron saint of saving things. Alice : Right? And now everyone's debating if he genuinely cares or if it's just good PR. It's like, can't a multi-millionaire just want cleaner oceans without an entire internet inquisition? Bob : Exactly! Though I do wonder sometimes if they actually know what they're talking about, or if they just have really good speechwriters. Remember that one pop star who tried to explain quantum physics for world peace? That was... ambitious. Alice : Oh, don't even get me started! It's always 'save the pandas' or 'end world hunger,' which, yes, are noble causes. But I'm waiting for a celebrity to champion something niche , like advocating for the return of the floppy disk. Bob : Now *that* would get my attention! Imagine Angelina Jolie passionately arguing for better floppy disk storage. I'd sign up for that mailing list instantly. Alice : Or maybe someone campaigning for the proper way to load a dishwasher. My roommate clearly needs a celebrity intervention on that front. Bob : See, those are issues that *really* affect daily life! It's easy to donate to a big cause, but it takes true dedication to show people how to arrange cutlery for optimal cleaning. Alice : Maybe we should start our own micro-celebrity activism movement. I'll be the face of 'No Socks with Sandals.' Bob : And I'll be the voice of 'One-Ply Toilet Paper is an Abomination.' We'd be internet sensations overnight! Alice : We'd probably just get shouted at by people who love their sandal- sock combo. Bob : True. It's a tough gig, even for actual celebrities. They put their neck out there , and half the internet calls them virtue-signaling hypocrites while the other half hails them as saviors. Alice : It's a lose-lose sometimes. But at least it gets people talking, right? Even if it's about Leo's perfectly windswept hair next to a single plastic bottle. Bob : Absolutely. Awareness is the first step, even if it comes with a side of eye-rolling. So, ready to draft our 'No Socks with Sandals' manifesto? Alice : Only if we get a professional photographer to capture our serious, thoughtful expressions. Maybe next to a discarded sock.
