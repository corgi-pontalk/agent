        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, you look like you just fought a bear! What happened?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, hi Alice. No bear, just my secret hobby. I was up late.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Secret hobby? Tell me, tell me! Are you secretly a superhero?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Even better! I'm a professional competitive napper. It's a lot of practice.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Laughing) A competitive napper? Bob, you're hilarious! How do you even compete?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, it's about speed and quality of sleep. And finding the most unusual places to nap. My current record is on a unicycle.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Wow, that's... unique! My hobby is a bit more traditional. I love collecting miniature rubber ducks.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Rubber ducks? Alice, that's adorable! Do they have tiny little hats?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Some do! I have a pirate duck and a doctor duck. They're very serious about their roles.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I bet they are. So, you nap on unicycles, I collect tiny ducks. We're quite the pair, aren't we?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Absolutely! But at least we both have something fun to do.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: True! Though I think my napping might actually <em>be</em> part of a bear fight. I'm still tired.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe you need a nap after your nap practice?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! It's a vicious cycle.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, good luck with your next unicycle nap, Bob!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Thanks, Alice! You too with your duck army!</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Hobbies are activities we enjoy doing in our free time for pleasure and relaxation. They are not part of our work or daily chores. Having hobbies is very important for our well-being because they help us relax, learn new things, develop skills, and meet new people. Common hobbies include reading, playing sports, painting, cooking, playing musical instruments, gardening, or collecting things. Hobbies can be very common, like watching movies, or very unique, like competitive napping or collecting miniature rubber ducks! What matters is that you enjoy them and they bring you joy.</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. The verb "To Be" (am, is, are)</h3>
        <p>The verb "to be" is one of the most common and important verbs in English. We use it to describe people, things, and situations. In the present simple tense, it changes form depending on the subject:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I am</strong> (e.g., <em>I am a competitive napper.</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>You are</strong> (e.g., <em>You are hilarious!</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>He/She/It is</strong> (e.g., <em>My hobby is collecting ducks. It is unique.</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>We are</strong> (e.g., <em>We are quite the pair.</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>They are</strong> (e.g., <em>They are very serious.</em>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Present Simple Tense for Habits and Routines</h3>
        <p>We use the present simple tense to talk about actions that happen regularly, habits, or facts. This is perfect for describing hobbies!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject + Verb (base form or -s/-es for he/she/it)</strong></li>
            <li>Examples from the dialogue:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>I <strong>love</strong> collecting miniature rubber ducks.</em> (A regular activity/habit)</li>
                    <li><em>My hobby <strong>is</strong> a bit more traditional.</em> (A fact/description)</li>
                    <li><em>I <strong>nap</strong> on unicycles.</em> (A regular action/habit)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remember: For "he," "she," and "it," add "-s" or "-es" to the verb (e.g., he plays, she reads, it rains).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Question Words (What, How)</h3>
        <p>These words help us ask for specific information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What</strong>: Used to ask about things, actions, or ideas.
                <ul>
                    <li><em><strong>What</strong> happened?</em> (Asking about an event)</li>
                    <li><em><strong>What</strong> is your hobby?</em> (Asking about a thing/activity)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How</strong>: Used to ask about the manner, way, or condition of something.
                <ul>
                    <li><em><strong>How</strong> do you even compete?</em> (Asking about the method)</li>
                    <li><em><strong>How</strong> are you?</em> (Asking about condition)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
