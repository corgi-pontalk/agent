    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, are you awake? You looked like you were dreaming about pizza during the lecture!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Oh, hey. Not pizza, but maybe a nap. This English class is... intense.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Intense? It's "Hello, my name is Bob." What's confusing you?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, the teacher keeps saying things. Like, "Open your books to page ten!" And I'm always on page five.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: <em>(chuckles)</em> That's "Open your books." Very important!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And then she says, "Listen carefully!" But my brain is still on page five.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You need to focus! What if you don't understand something?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I usually just nod. But last time, she asked, "Does anyone have a question?" and I accidentally said "Yes!"</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no! What did you ask?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I panicked! I just blurted out, "What does 'pen' mean?" She held up a pen.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: <em>(laughs hard)</em> Bob! That's a basic word! You could have said, "Can you speak more slowly, please?"</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Good point! Or, "Could you repeat that?" I always forget those.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Or, "Excuse me, I don't understand." It's okay to ask!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You're right. I guess I need to learn this "classroom English" properly. Otherwise, I'll be asking what "chair" means next week.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! Now, <em>open your mind</em> to learning! We have a quiz tomorrow.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: A quiz?! Oh no, I need to "listen carefully" now!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Imperatives (Commands)</h3>
    <p>Imperatives are used to give direct orders, instructions, or advice. They use the base form of the verb without a subject (because the subject "you" is understood).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive:</strong> <strong>Verb (base form)</strong> + ...
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <strong>Open</strong> your books.</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>Listen</strong> carefully.</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>Sit</strong> down.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Negative:</strong> <strong>Don't</strong> + <strong>Verb (base form)</strong> + ...
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <strong>Don't talk</strong> during the exam.</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>Don't forget</strong> your homework.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Requests and Permissions</h3>
    <p>Modal verbs like "Can," "Could," and "May" are used to make polite requests or ask for permission.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Can I...?</strong> (More informal, but still polite)
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <strong>Can I ask</strong> a question?</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>Can I borrow</strong> your pen?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Could you...?</strong> (More polite for requests to others)
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <strong>Could you repeat</strong> that, please?</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>Could you speak</strong> more slowly?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>May I...?</strong> (Most formal and polite for asking permission, especially from a teacher or authority)
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <strong>May I go</strong> to the restroom?</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>May I come</strong> in?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Question Words for Definitions and Spelling</h3>
    <p>We use specific question words to ask about meaning and spelling.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What does [word] mean?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use "what" to ask for the definition or explanation of a word or phrase.</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>What does 'dictionary' mean?</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How do you spell [word]?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use "how" to ask for the letters that form a word.</li>
                <li>Example: <strong>How do you spell 'chocolate'?</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
