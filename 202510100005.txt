Alice : Hey Bob, did you see that news about the ancient footprints found in the UK? Bob : Alice! You mean the ones from, like, a _really_ long time ago? I just skimmed the headline! Alice : "Skimmed the headline" is your specialty. Yes, _those_ ones. Apparently, they're over 800,000 years old. Mind-boggling, right? Bob : Eight hundred thousand? That's practically prehistoric! I can almost picture some ancient Brit trying to find their car keys, then just sighing and walking. Alice : More like trying to find a mammoth to chase, Bob. No car keys back then. And probably a lot more mud. Bob : Mud, sure. But imagine the drama! "Oh no, I left my spear back at the cave!" Alice : Or "Whose muddy footprint is _this_ on the clean cave floor again?" Ancient domestic disputes. Bob : Exactly! I wonder what they were doing. Just strolling along, enjoying the scenery? Maybe going for an ancient jog? Alice : Probably foraging for food or escaping a saber-toothed tiger. Not exactly a leisurely Sunday afternoon walk. Bob : You're ruining my romantic vision of ancient strolls! I was picturing them with little ancient binoculars. Alice : And ancient little hats, I suppose? Let's be real, it was probably chilly and damp. Classic British weather, even 800,000 years ago. Bob : True. So, what do you think they'll do with them? Put a little velvet rope around them? Alice : They're already eroding pretty fast, so probably more about documentation and preserving the data. Not exactly a theme park attraction. Bob : Aww. No "Ancient Footprint Land"? What a missed opportunity. I was already planning my visit, trying to find _my_ ancestral toe-print. Alice : I think you're about 800,000 years too late, and a few evolutionary steps off, Bob. Bob : A guy can dream, Alice! A guy can dream. Maybe _my_ giant feet are a genetic throwback. Alice : Highly unlikely. Now, fancy getting some coffee? We can leave our _modern_ footprints on the pavement. Bob : Lead the way, Alice! Just watch out for any unsuspecting ancient puddles.
