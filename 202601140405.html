    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob! You look super busy. Are you wrestling with a new robot at work?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hi Alice! No robots today, thankfully. Just trying to send an email to a client. My computer is being... dramatic.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ah, the classic tech drama! My laptop decided to update itself right before my <b>online meeting</b> this morning. I almost missed it!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh no! That sounds stressful. At least you <i>have</i> online meetings. My boss still prefers carrier pigeons. Kidding! We use video calls, too.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Video calls are great, right? I <b>can work from home</b> sometimes, thanks to all our <b>digital tools</b>. It <b>saves so much time</b>.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Absolutely! And sharing documents online <b>makes teamwork so much easier</b>. No more printing mountains of paper. My back thanks technology.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Mine too! Remember when we had to fax everything? Now it's just a click. And our company uses an app for project management. It keeps everyone <b>on track</b>.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: An app for project management? That's smart! We still use a whiteboard sometimes. Though, our new <b>CRM software</b> is a lifesaver for customer data.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: CRM? Oh, Customer Relationship Management, right? That sounds super useful for sales. Is it easy to learn?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It was a bit tricky at first, but now I can't imagine work without it. It helps us remember everything about our clients.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That's the power of technology, I guess. It <b>makes businesses more efficient</b>. Even when your computer is being dramatic!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: True! Even with the occasional drama, I think technology helps us get more done. And sometimes, it's actually fun.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Fun? Like when the office printer actually works on the first try?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Or when you find a new shortcut that saves you five whole seconds. Pure joy!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You're easily entertained, Bob. But I agree. Tech really changed how we do business.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Definitely. Now, if only my email would finally send...</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Simple (for habits and facts)</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about things that happen regularly, general truths, or facts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> Subject + Verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it)</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Alice <b>works</b> from home sometimes. (A regular activity)</li>
                <li>Technology <b>helps</b> businesses. (A general truth)</li>
                <li>They <b>use</b> video calls. (A regular activity)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Modal Verb "Can" (for ability and possibility)</h3>
    <p>"Can" shows that something is possible or that someone has the ability to do something.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> Subject + can + base form of verb (no -s/-es)</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>I <b>can work</b> from home sometimes. (It's possible for me to work from home)</li>
                <li>I <b>can't imagine</b> work without it. (I am not able to imagine)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. "Make" + Object + Adjective (to cause something to become)</h3>
    <p>We use "make" followed by an object and an adjective to describe causing a change in something.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> Subject + make + object + adjective</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Sharing documents online <b>makes teamwork easier</b>. (Teamwork becomes easier)</li>
                <li>It <b>makes businesses more efficient</b>. (Businesses become more efficient)</li>
            </ul>
