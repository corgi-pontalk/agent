Alice: Hi Bob! How was your day?
Bob: Oh, Alice, it was... school. You know. Lots of books!
Alice: Haha, I know! My brain feels like soup after my math class.
Bob: Math is tough! What was your favorite class today?
Alice: Hmm, maybe art class. We painted silly animals. My elephant looked like a potato.
Bob: That sounds fun! My history teacher told a really long story about old kings. I almost fell asleep.
Alice: Oh no! Did he notice?
Bob: I don't think so! I was very good at pretending to be awake. What about homework? Any big projects?
Alice: Just a big essay for English. It's about dreams. I just want to dream about no homework!
Bob: Tell me about it! I have a science experiment due tomorrow. I think my volcano will just fizzle.
Alice: Good luck! Are you studying for the big science test next week?
Bob: Uh oh, next week? I completely forgot! Thanks for the reminder, Alice!
Alice: No problem! Maybe we can study together sometime?
Bob: Great idea! After school, maybe? Or Saturday?
Alice: Saturday sounds good! Let's get through the week first.
Bob: Deal! And no more potato elephants for you!
Alice: Hey! My potato elephant was majestic!
