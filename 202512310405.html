    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-container">
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, Bob, I had the weirdest day at my new customer service job!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Tell me, Alice! Was it more "help me" or "please don't help me"?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> A bit of both! I spent all day practicing phrases. My manager kept saying, "Be polite, be helpful!"</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Like what? "Welcome to our store, how may I assist you today?"</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly! And "Is there anything else I can help you with?" I said that about fifty times.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> <em>(laughs)</em> Did you ever get to say, "Your call is important to us, please hold"?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> No, thankfully! But I did have to say, "I apologize for the inconvenience." A customer thought their cat ordered a hundred cans of tuna online.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> A cat? That's amazing! Did you offer a "full refund"?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Of course! And then I asked, "How can I help you further?" They just wanted to know if we sell cat toys.</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> So, you're becoming a customer service guru! Can you say, "Thank you for calling"?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Yes! "Thank you for calling, have a great day!" See? I'm getting good at it!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> You are! What if someone says, "I'd like to make a complaint"?</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Then I'd say, "I understand. Could you please explain the issue?" That's a tricky one!</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Very professional! Next time, try, "Please bear with me for a moment."</p>
        <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, that's a good one! I'll add it to my list. Maybe I'll even sound like I know what I'm doing soon!</p>
