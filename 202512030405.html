    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, how was your online class today? Mine was... very interesting.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh Alice, tell me! Mine involved my cat trying to teach the class. He kept meowing at the screen!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Seriously? My tutor accidentally wore a banana costume for the first half hour! He forgot his camera was on.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> No way! A banana? That's amazing. I once saw someone's little brother pop up in the background wearing a superhero mask.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha! My internet connection keeps dropping. I spend half the class reconnecting, saying, "Can you hear me now?"</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, the classic! I always worry if my microphone is off when I'm singing along to music.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Me too! Or when I'm talking to myself. I nearly said "What is this nonsense?" out loud during a lecture.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Close call! Do you ever just stay in your pajamas all day because of online classes?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, is that even a question? My pajamas are my new uniform! Comfort first, always.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Mine too! My brain is learning, but my legs are still in bed. It’s a strange feeling.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's great for learning from home, but sometimes I miss seeing people in person.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, me too. But at least we don't have to worry about running late for class! Just roll out of bed and log in.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> True! And no traffic jams. I guess online classes have their funny moments and good points.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Definitely! Even with banana tutors and singing cats. It's never boring.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely. See you later, Bob!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Online classes are learning sessions that happen over the internet. Students and teachers use computers or phones to connect from different places.

    <p>Many people enjoy online classes because they offer flexibility and convenience. You can often learn at your own pace and from anywhere. However, they can also come with challenges like internet connection problems, distractions at home, or sometimes missing the face-to-face interaction with classmates and teachers.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Simple</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about habits, routines, facts, and general truths.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + Verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it)</li>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"My internet connection <strong>keeps dropping</strong>." (A routine problem)</li>
                <li>"I always <strong>worry</strong> if my microphone is off." (A habit)</li>
                <li>"My pajamas <strong>are</strong> my new uniform!" (A general truth/fact)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Complete the sentences with the correct form of the verb.

            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Present Continuous</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Continuous to talk about actions happening right now, at this moment, or temporary situations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + am/is/are + Verb-ing</li>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"My cat <strong>is trying</strong> to teach the class." (Happening now)</li>
                <li>"My brain <strong>is learning</strong>, but my legs <strong>are still in bed</strong>." (Happening now/temporary state)</li>
                <li>"I'm <strong>singing</strong> along to music." (Happening at that moment)</li>
            </ul>
