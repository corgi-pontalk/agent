        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob! Finally! I thought they'd kept you forever. Did you tell them your life story?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you wouldn't believe it! That immigration officer asked me the <em>weirdest</em> question.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no, what was it? Did he ask if you're secretly a pop star?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: He asked, "What is the purpose of your visit?"</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Giggles) That's a normal question, Bob! They always ask that.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: But then he looked at my passport photo and my face, and asked, "Is that <em>really</em> you?"</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Laughs harder) Oh, poor Bob! Your passport photo is prettyâ€¦ adventurous, let's say.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It is! I told him, "Yes, it's me, just... before coffee."</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Did he laugh?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: He just stared. And then asked, "How long will you be staying?"</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: And you said... "Forever, if the food is good?"</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I said, "Two weeks, exploring all the delicious food!" He seemed to like that answer, thankfully.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good save! My officer was super quick. "Passport, please. Purpose of visit? Enjoy your stay!" Done!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Lucky you. I think I need a new passport photo... and a coffee. Let's get out of here.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Definitely! Come on, let's find our bags and some breakfast.</p>

    <div class="current-situation-box">
        <h2>Current Situation: At Immigration</h2>
        <p>When you travel to another country, you need to go through "immigration." This is where an officer checks your passport and asks you a few questions to make sure you can enter the country. It's a normal and important part of international travel. Don't be nervous, just be polite and have your documents ready!</p>
        <p>Common things they ask about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose of your visit:</strong> Why are you coming to this country? (e.g., tourism, business, visiting family)</li>
            <li><strong>How long will you be staying?:</strong> How many days or weeks will you stay?</li>
            <li><strong>Where are you staying?:</strong> Your hotel name or address.</li>
            <li><strong>Passport, please:</strong> They need to see your passport.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> Always answer clearly and honestly. A smile can help too!</p>

    <div class="grammar-box">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Simple Present Tense for facts and regular actions</h3>
        <p>We use the simple present tense to talk about things that are generally true, facts, or habits.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>3. The "Be" Verb (is, am, are)</h3>
        <p>The verb "to be" is very common. We use it to describe identity, location, feelings, and status.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I am:</strong> "I <strong>am</strong> hungry."</li>
            <li><strong>You are:</strong> "You <strong>are</strong> right."</li>
