Alice : Hey Bob, how was your first day at the new office? Any fun stories, or just a mountain of paperwork? Bob : Alice, it was... an adventure! My _desk_ is so small, I can barely fit my _coffee mug_. And the _chair_? It feels like it's plotting against my back! Alice : (Laughing) Oh no! Did you at least get a decent _computer setup_? Bob : The _laptop_ is fine, but the _monitor_ is gargantuan! It's like watching a movie in IMAX. And the _keyboard_... it has '_sticky keys_.' I suspect a spilled soda from a previous employee. Alice : Sticky keys already? Bob, you definitely need new _office supplies_. Maybe a fresh _pen_ that doesn't explode when you write. Bob : I did find a _stapler_ , but it only had one _staple_ left. One! For all my important _documents_! And it ran out of _paper_ immediately. Alice : (Giggles) Sounds like you're in an office comedy. Did you find the _printer_ or the dreaded _photocopier_? Bob : The printer just blinked "_out of toner_ " at me like it was mocking my existence. And the photocopier? It _ate three sheets of paper_ , then jammed! It clearly has a vendetta. Alice : Welcome to the jungle, my friend! Any exciting _meetings_? Bob : Oh, yes. We had one in the _meeting room_. It had a giant _whiteboard_ , perfect for _brainstorming_... but zero _markers_. We just stared at it. Alice : (Shaking her head playfully) Classic! At least you're getting to know your new _colleagues_. Bob : True. One of them, a true hero, actually managed to get the _coffee machine_ working. He deserves a medal! Alice : A _coffee machine hero_! That's a good sign, Bob. You'll navigate this office maze in no time. Bob : I hope so! I just need more _paper_ , a _stapler_ that actually works, and maybe a _mouse_ that doesn't jump across the screen by itself. Alice : Don't worry, you'll _master office survival_. Just make sure you guard your good pens!
