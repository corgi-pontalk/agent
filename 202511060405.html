    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, Bob, I'm so hungry my stomach thinks it's an echo chamber! What are we going to do?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, you look like you're about to eat the wallpaper! Don't worry, I have a brilliant idea!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Please tell me it involves food and zero effort.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! Room service! We just call, they bring food, magic!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Magic? Or just really good customer service. Do you have the menu?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Uh... I think it's... somewhere. Ah, found it! Under the lamp, next to the remote!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Great. What looks good? I'm craving something cheesy.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hmm, they have a 'Giant Nacho Volcano'. Or a 'Sleepy Bear Pizza'.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A 'Sleepy Bear Pizza'? What even is that? Let's stick to something safe, like a club sandwich.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: But the nachos sound so adventurous! Okay, okay. So, how do we call them?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Usually, there's a button on the phone for 'Room Service' or 'Guest Services'.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (Picks up phone) Okay, found it! Ringing... Hello? Yes, we'd like to order some food.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Whispering) Be polite, Bob! And tell them your room number!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, right! Room 302. And could we get one club sandwich and... one Giant Nacho Volcano, please?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Facepalm) Bob!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: What? It's for sharing! And maybe two chocolate milkshakes!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Room service is a convenient service offered by hotels that allows guests to order food and drinks directly to their room. It's perfect when you're tired after a long journey, feeling lazy on a holiday, or just want a private meal without going to a restaurant. You usually find a menu in your room, often near the phone, and simply dial a specific number or button for "Room Service" or "Guest Services." When you call, you'll need to tell them your room number and what you'd like to order. Sometimes, they might ask about any allergies or special requests. After you order, a hotel staff member will bring the food to your room. It's a great way to enjoy a meal in comfort!</p>

            <li><strong>Present Simple (for general statements and current feelings)</strong>:
                <br>We use the present simple to talk about things that are always true, habits, or current states.

                <br><em>Structure: Subject + Verb (or Subject + 'am/is/are' + Adjective/Noun)</em></li>
