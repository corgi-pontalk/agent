    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, your wallet looks a bit flat. Did a dragon fly through it again?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you noticed! It's more of a financial black hole after my weekend shopping spree.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no! What happened? Another limited-edition comic book?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Worse! It was a vintage video game console. Totally 'essential' for my happiness!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Essential? Bob, we need to talk about finance basics. Like, 'budgeting'!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Budgeting? Is that like telling my money where to go instead of watching it vanish?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! It's like a map for your money. First, know your 'income'. How much money do you earn?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Uhm, enough for coffee... and sometimes vintage consoles. What's the next step on this map?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Then, track your 'expenses'. Every coffee, every game. You'll see where your money goes.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, that sounds like homework for my wallet! Can't I just win the lottery?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You can dream! But also, try to 'save' some money. It's for future goals, like a new apartment or a proper vacation.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Save? My 'savings account' is usually just the bottom of my piggy bank. Which is currently empty.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha! Small amounts add up. Even ten dollars a week is a start. And try to avoid 'debt' – borrowing money you can't easily pay back.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Debt... like that time I bought too many pizzas and owed my roommate?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! But bigger. So, budget, track, save, and avoid bad debt. Got it?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Got it, Alice! No more financial black holes. Just smart money moves. Thanks for the mini finance lesson!</p>
