    <h1>Dialogue</h1>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, did you hear about China's incredible plans for a lunar base? It just <em>blows my mind</em>!</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice, you mean they're actually building houses on the moon? I thought that was just <em>science fiction</em>!</p>
        <p>Alice: Apparently, it's becoming <em>science fact</em>! They're aiming for the 2030s. Can you imagine?</p>
        <p>Bob: The 2030s? So, by then, instead of complaining about traffic jams on Earth, we'll be stuck in lunar rover queues?</p>
        <p>Alice: Ha! Don't <em>get ahead of yourself</em>. It'll probably be for scientific research first, not moon tourism.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, come on, Alice, dream a little! <em>Picture this</em>: a cozy little dome, panoramic views of Earth, zero-gravity basketball...</p>
        <p>Alice: And zero-gravity dirty laundry! Who's going to do the dishes in space, Bob? Astronauts or moon robots?</p>
        <p>Bob: Details, details! I'm already envisioning my moon property. Do you think I can get a good deal on a crater with a view?</p>
        <p>Alice: You're <em>jumping the gun</em> a bit. They're still figuring out how to generate power and extract resources like lunar ice.</p>
        <p>Bob: So, no moon resorts just yet? My dreams of opening "Bob's Lunar BBQ Joint" are shattered.</p>
        <p>Alice: Maybe "Bob's Lunar Freeze-Dried Noodle Bar" is more realistic for now. But seriously, it's a huge <em>leap forward</em> for space exploration.</p>
        <p>Bob: It really is. Imagine the scientific discoveries, the potential for new resources... it's a total <em>game-changer</em>.</p>
        <p>Alice: Absolutely. We're <em>on the cusp of</em> a new era. Who knows, maybe one day we'll be having coffee on the moon!</p>
        <p>Bob: And you can finally pay me back for that coffee on Earth! Deal?</p>
        <p>Alice: Only if you promise to do the zero-gravity dishes.</p>
        <p>Bob: Deal! See you on the moon, Alice!</p>

    <h1>Current Situation</h1>
    <p>China has ambitious plans to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon, a project officially referred to as the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). Collaborating with Russia and other international partners, China aims to construct a comprehensive base primarily for scientific research, resource utilization, and technological verification. The long-term vision includes developing lunar habitats, power generation systems, communication infrastructure, and facilities for scientific experiments. The initial phase is targeting the 2030s for the deployment of core infrastructure, with a more extensive operational base expected by the 2040s. This initiative represents a significant step towards deep space exploration and potentially opens doors for future lunar industries and resource extraction.</p>

    <h1>Grammar Points</h1>
    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h2>1. The Present Perfect Tense for Recent News/Experiences</h2>
        <p>The Present Perfect tense (have/has + past participle) is often used to talk about events that happened at an unspecified time in the past but have a connection to the present. It's particularly useful for sharing recent news or experiences.</p>
        <p>The phrase <strong>"Have you heard...?"</strong> is a common way to introduce recent news. It implies that the news is fresh and relevant now.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + have/has + past participle.</li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue context:</strong> While Alice uses "did you hear" (Simple Past), a common and equally natural way to ask about recent news is with the Present Perfect: "<strong>Have you heard</strong> about China's incredible plans for a lunar base?"</li>
            <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "I <strong>haven't seen</strong> Sarah recently. Is she okay?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Future Simple (Will/Going To) for Plans and Predictions</h2>
        <p>Both "will" and "going to" are used to talk about the future, but they often imply slightly different things.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Will"</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Used for <strong>predictions</strong> based on opinion or belief: "I think it <strong>will</strong> rain tomorrow."</li>
                    <li>Used for <strong>spontaneous decisions</strong> made at the moment of speaking: "I'm tired, I <strong>will make</strong> myself some coffee."</li>
                    <li>Used for <strong>promises</strong> or offers: "I <strong>will call</strong> you tonight."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>"Going to"</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Used for <strong>prior plans</strong> or intentions (something you've already decided to do): "I'm <strong>going to visit</strong> my parents next weekend."</li>
                    <li>Used for <strong>predictions based on present evidence</strong> (you can see or feel that something is about to happen): "Look at those dark clouds; it's <strong>going to rain</strong>."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bob: "...we'll <strong>be stuck</strong> in lunar rover queues?" (Prediction using "will")</li>
                    <li>Alice: "Who's <strong>going to do</strong> the dishes in space, Bob?" (Asking about a future action/responsibility, implying a prior plan or intention for who will be responsible).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
