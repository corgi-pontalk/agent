Alice : Oh, hey Bob! I'm just looking at some... interesting statistics. Bob : Statistics? About what, Alice? Your online shopping habits? Alice : No, much more important! I'm tracking how many times my cat, Mittens, naps in a day. Bob : Seriously? That's a lot of data for a cat nap! Alice : It is! My current data shows an average of 12 naps per day. That's a lot of sleep! Bob : Wow. And what's the average duration? Are you collecting all the data points? Alice : Yes! I have a chart. The mean nap length is 30 minutes, but there's a huge variance. Sometimes just 5 minutes, sometimes two hours! Bob : So, the mode is probably 'short nap,' right? Alice : Exactly! And the standard deviation is quite high. Mittens is unpredictable. Bob : This sounds like a serious research project. Are you going to publish a report? Alice : Maybe! I need to collect more data first. I'm looking for a larger sample size. Bob : I see. My data on how many times _I_ lose my phone daily is also quite robust. Alice : Oh? What's your mean number of losses? Bob : About 3.5. But there's a strong correlation with how tired I am. Alice : Fascinating! We should collaborate. We could be the world's leading experts in 'Everyday Useless Data'! Bob : I'm in! Let's get more data!
