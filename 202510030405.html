    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Ugh, Bob, this line is so long! Are we ever going to get to the counter?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Relax, Alice! We're almost there. What are you sending that's so urgent?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: It's a huge box for my grandma's birthday. It's full of handmade socks and her favorite tea. Don't laugh!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Wow, that box looks heavy! Are you sure it's not full of rocks? Just kidding, just kidding!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Very funny! So, do I need special stamps, or should I send it as 'registered mail' to make sure it arrives safely?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: 'Registered mail' is a good idea for something important. You'll need to fill out a form for that. Do you have a pen?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: A pen? Oh no! I totally forgot my pen! I always do that. Do you, by any chance, have an extra one?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: My lucky day! I always carry my trusty pen. Here you go, Super Sender!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, thanks, Bob! And, uh, where do I buy the packing tape? This box is trying to open itself.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: They usually have it at the counter, or sometimes there's a small self-service station near the entrance.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Phew, this is more complicated than sending a text message. I might need a coffee after this.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Don't worry, you're doing great! And your grandma will love those socks. What's the address again?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, I have it written on a small paper... somewhere. Wait, here it is!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Good! Make sure you write it clearly on the form. And remember to put the return address too!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Okay, okay, wish me luck with this paperwork monster!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Even in today's digital world, visiting a post office is still a common activity for many people. While we send emails and text messages every day, there are times when we need to send physical items. For example, you might send a birthday gift to a friend or family member who lives far away, or mail important documents. Post offices offer various services like sending letters, packages, buying stamps, and even 'registered mail' for important items that need tracking and a signature upon delivery. It's a place where you interact with staff to ensure your mail gets to the right place safely.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Present Continuous (for ongoing actions and future plans)</h3>
        <p>We use the **Present Continuous** (am/is/are + verb-ing) to talk about actions happening *now* or plans for the *near future*.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Happening now:</strong>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: "What <span class="speaker">are you sending</span>?" (asking about an action happening at the moment)</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: "This box <span class="speaker">is trying</span> to open itself." (describing an ongoing action)</em></p></li>
            <li><strong>Future plans (often for definite arrangements):</strong>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">We are going</span> to the park later.</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">I'm having</span> dinner with my family tonight.</em></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Modal Verb: "Need to" (for necessity)</h3>
        <p>We use **"need to"** to express something that is necessary or important to do.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + need to + base form of verb
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: "Do <span class="speaker">I need to</span> special stamps...?"</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: "You'll <span class="speaker">need to</span> fill out a form..."</em></p></li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>I <span class="speaker">need to buy</span> groceries today.</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>They <span class="speaker">need to study</span> for the test.</em></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Prepositions of Place: "at," "near," "to"</h3>
        <p>Prepositions tell us about location, time, or direction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>at:</strong> Used for a specific point or location.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: "Are we ever going to get <span class="speaker">at the counter</span>?"</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>The books are <span class="speaker">at the library</span>.</em></p></li>
            <li><strong>near:</strong> Used for a close proximity.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: "...a small self-service station <span class="speaker">near the entrance</span>."</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>My house is <span class="speaker">near the school</span>.</em></p></li>
            <li><strong>to:</strong> Used for direction or destination.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: "It's a huge box for my grandma's birthday." (implies sending it <span class="speaker">to</span> her)</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>I'm going <span class="speaker">to the post office</span>.</em></p></li>

                <li>on (Note: 'at' can also be correct depending on context, but 'on' is more specific for 'on the surface'. For beginners, 'at' might be used for 'at a location'. However, given the options, 'on' is not there, so I will stick to 'at'.) *Self-correction: The options are only 'at, near, to'. So 'at' is the best choice here.*</li>
