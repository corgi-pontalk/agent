    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, Bob! Fancy seeing you here! What are you doing in the fruit aisle?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Well, I'm trying to find a perfectly ripe banana, but it seems like a mission impossible! What about you? Your cart looks… colorful.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Mine? Oh, I'm on a top-secret mission for a party. See this? (holds up a jar) Giant dill pickles, extra sour!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Giant dill pickles? For a party? That sounds… unique. Is that next to the bright green ice cream?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It is! And this (points to a small bottle) is super-spicy hot sauce! The guest of honor loves a challenge.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Wow, Alice. Your guests must have very adventurous taste buds. I'm just here for milk and some whole wheat bread. Very exciting, I know.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Milk and bread? Bob, you're so predictable! But also, very practical. I totally forgot milk. Do you need anything else?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hmm, maybe some eggs. And to avoid your spicy pickles, perhaps some chocolate? For balance, you know.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Good idea! I need to find the cereal aisle too. My list also says "sprinkles... and a single, lonely onion."</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A single, lonely onion? Alice, are you making an onion sundae? Because that sounds like a dare!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ha! No, it's for the savory part of the party. Don't worry, no onion sundaes on my watch. But I did almost grab a rubber chicken earlier.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A rubber chicken? You have to tell me about this party later. It sounds legendary.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It will be! Well, good luck with your banana quest and your normal, sensible groceries, Bob.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> And you too, Alice! Good luck with the pickles and the lonely onion! See you around!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> See ya, Bob! Don't forget the chocolate for balance!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Supermarkets are large self-service stores where people buy food and other household items. They are very common in most towns and cities. When you go to a supermarket, you typically grab a shopping cart or basket, walk through different aisles (like the "fruit aisle," "dairy aisle," or "cereal aisle"), pick up the items you need, and then pay at the checkout counter. It's a place where you often bump into friends or acquaintances, just like Alice and Bob did!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. "To be" verbs (is, am, are)</h3>
        <p>The verb "to be" is one of the most common and important verbs in English. It changes form depending on the subject.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I am</strong> (I'm)</li>
            <li><strong>You are</strong> (You're)</li>
            <li><strong>He is</strong> (He's) / <strong>She is</strong> (She's) / <strong>It is</strong> (It's)</li>
            <li><strong>We are</strong> (We're)</li>
            <li><strong>They are</strong> (They're)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use "to be" to talk about who someone is, what something is, where someone is, or how someone feels.</p>
        <p><em>Examples from dialogue:</em><br>
        - What <strong>are</strong> you doing? (talking about Bob's action)<br>
        - Oh, I<strong>'m</strong> on a top-secret mission. (talking about Alice's activity)<br>
        - It <strong>is</strong>! And this <strong>is</strong> super-spicy hot sauce! (talking about the items)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Present Continuous Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the Present Continuous tense to talk about actions that are happening <strong>right now</strong>, at the moment of speaking, or around this time.</p>
        <p><strong>Form:</strong> <code>subject + am/is/are + verb-ing</code></p>
        <p><em>Examples from dialogue:</em><br>
        - What <strong>are you doing</strong> in the fruit aisle? (Asking about Bob's current action)<br>
        - I<strong>'m trying</strong> to find a perfectly ripe banana. (Describing Bob's action at that moment)<br>
        - I<strong>'m on</strong> a top-secret mission. (This means "I am doing" a mission. Here 'on' is a preposition and 'mission' is a noun, but it functions like a continuous activity.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Countable and Uncountable Nouns</h3>
        <p>Nouns in English can be countable or uncountable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Countable Nouns:</strong> These are things we can count. They have singular and plural forms. We can use numbers (one, two, three) or "a/an" with them.
                <br><em>Examples: a banana, two pickles, an onion, three eggs.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Uncountable Nouns:</strong> These are things we cannot count individually. They usually don't have a plural form. We often use words like "some," "much," "a lot of," or specific measures (e.g., "a carton of...") with them.
                <br><em>Examples: milk, bread, hot sauce, ice cream, water, information.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Examples from dialogue:</em><br>
        - "a perfectly ripe <strong>banana</strong>" (countable, singular)<br>
        - "Giant dill <strong>pickles</strong>" (countable, plural)<br>
        - "super-spicy <strong>hot sauce</strong>" (uncountable)<br>
        - "<strong>milk</strong> and some whole wheat <strong>bread</strong>" (uncountable)<br>
        - "a single, lonely <strong>onion</strong>" (countable, singular, emphasized)</p>
