Alice: Hey, Bob! Is that really you hiding behind that tree?
Bob: (peeking out) Alice! You found me! I was trying to be a ninja.
Alice: A ninja? In a bright yellow hat? That's a new strategy!
Bob: It's for camouflage... for pigeons. They never see it coming.
Alice: Pigeons? Are you planning a secret pigeon meeting?
Bob: Shhh! It's classified. But they bring snacks.
Alice: I knew it! You're always thinking about food.
Bob: Well, running from squirrels is hard work! And they're fast.
Alice: You run from squirrels? Bob, they're tiny.
Bob: They have tiny, angry eyes, Alice! And sharp claws!
Alice: (laughing) Okay, okay. So, what's the actual plan for today?
Bob: I was going to read my comic book. But now I'm thinking about ice cream.
Alice: Ice cream sounds much better than pigeon secrets or squirrel chases.
Bob: Definitely! My treat?
Alice: Deal! But no ninja moves on the way to the ice cream truck.
Bob: No promises! (He winks and starts jogging)
Alice: (shakes her head, smiling) Oh, Bob.
