    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what I saw today?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: What, Alice? Another squirrel trying to pay for coffee?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: No, but close! I saw someone arguing with a traffic light. Like, <em>really</em> arguing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Haha! That's a classic case of... uh... 'social deviance' maybe?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Social deviance? Is that a fancy way of saying 'crazy person'?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, in sociology, it means acting differently from what society usually expects. Like, most people don't yell at traffic lights.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, the 'rules' for acting are called 'social norms' then?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Like waiting in line at the store. That's a social norm.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, I get it! So, when I pretend not to see someone I know in a supermarket to avoid talking, is that a social norm?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: That's a 'social strategy'! But avoiding people isn't a <em>norm</em>... unless you're a secret agent.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: What about 'social roles'? Like, you're a student, I'm a barista. Is that a social role?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Yes! And when we're together, we have the role of 'friends'. We act differently with friends than with our boss, right?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Totally! I wouldn't ask my boss if they want to share my giant cookie.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: See? Different roles, different expectations. It's like a play, but everyone is a character.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Wow, Bob, you're surprisingly good at explaining this 'sociology stuff'! Maybe you should teach a class.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Nah, I just pay attention in class. Want to study social interaction over coffee?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Only if we don't argue with the coffee machine!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Sociology is the study of human society, groups, and how people interact. It helps us understand why we behave the way we do, why societies have certain rules (called <strong>social norms</strong>), and how our positions in society (called <strong>social roles</strong>) influence us. For beginners, understanding sociology basics can make sense of everyday situations, from why people wait in line to how different cultures operate. It makes the world around you more understandable and interesting by providing a framework to observe and interpret human behavior and social structures.</p>
