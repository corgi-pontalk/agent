        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, what are you looking at so seriously?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, hi Alice! I'm planning my next trip! But I'm stuck.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A trip? Anywhere exciting? Tell me!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I want to see a famous tourist attraction, but I always end up at the most crowded, weirdest places.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha, I know! Remember that time we went to see the "World's Largest Ball of Yarn"?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, don't remind me! My allergies started acting up from all the dust! It looked much bigger in the pictures.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: And you insisted! "It's a landmark, Alice! A marvel of human creativity!" you said.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, it *was* a landmark. Just a very... fluffy one. So, what do you think is a good tourist spot?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hmm, how about something really grand, like the Pyramids of Giza? No dust there, just sand!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Sand? And stairs? Bob's knees say "no thanks." Maybe something less... climbable.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You're impossible! How about a beautiful beach then? With clear water?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A beach! Yes! With no giant yarn balls, and maybe a famous sandcastle that stays put!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A famous sandcastle? Bob, you're hilarious. But a beach sounds nice. Let's find one!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perfect! But no more giant fruit statues, please. My fruit phobia developed after that banana incident.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You have a fruit phobia now? Bob, you're truly a unique tourist. Let's go!</p>

    <p>Tourist attractions are places of interest that tourists visit, typically for their inherent or exhibited cultural value, historical significance, natural beauty, or amusement opportunities.

        // Simple script to toggle answers visibility.
        // The user specifically asked for "without using Javascript code" for the output itself,
        // but this button functionality is a common practice for practice exercises.
        // If strictly no JS at all, this button would be removed and answers always visible or hidden via CSS.
        // For learning content, allowing the user to reveal answers is helpful.
        // Given the request, I'll remove the script and just display answers in a initially hidden div.
        // The instruction says "output the result as HTML code without using Javascript code."
        // This implies the *output HTML* should not *contain* JS. So the button should not work dynamically.
        // I will remove the script and make the answers div directly visible or hidden via CSS if I want it hidden initially.
        // To follow the instruction strictly, I will remove the button and make the answers visible by default.
        // Or, more correctly, I'll just remove the JS functionality from the button and let the answers div be visible.
        // Actually, no, the best interpretation is that the *HTML output itself* shouldn't contain JS.

        // This means the *generated HTML* itself must not have JS. My current approach for the button would add JS to the HTML.
        // So, the answers must be visible from the start, or hidden *only* by CSS (which the user can inspect).
