    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Hey Bob, you look like you're plotting world domination, or at least a very complicated sandwich.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! You caught me. I was actually just thinking about something I saw on the news about homelessness in major U.S. cities. It's... intense.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Tell me about it. It’s a huge challenge, isn't it?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Absolutely. I saw a segment about tents popping up in parks. I mean, do they just... buy a tent and that's it? No permits, no zoning regulations for pop-up neighborhoods?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> (chuckles) Bob, it's not exactly glamping. It's often a last resort when people have literally nowhere else to go.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> I know, I know. My brain just goes to the practicalities. Like, if I wanted to set up a tent in Central Park, I'd probably get arrested for "unauthorized leisure activities."
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> You probably would! But for many experiencing homelessness, it's a matter of survival, not leisure. The number of people sleeping rough has actually been on the rise in some places.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Right, "sleeping rough." That's the polite term for "outside, with no roof."
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Precisely. And it's not just visible tent encampments. There are also people living in their cars, or couch-surfing with friends. The issue is much broader than what you see on the street.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> So it's not just "visible homelessness." There's a whole invisible layer? Like a homelessness iceberg?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly! Many factors contribute: lack of affordable housing, mental health issues, substance abuse, job loss... it's a complex web.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> I saw San Francisco was trying some "safe sleeping sites." Is that like a designated tent zone with Wi-Fi? Because that actually sounds... efficient.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> More like designated areas with some basic services, safety, and hygiene facilities. It's an attempt to manage the immediate crisis while more permanent solutions are explored.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> See, I told you I had practical ideas! Next, I'll propose "homelessness reduction quotas" for cities. If you don't reduce your numbers, no more federal funding for fancy bike lanes!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> (rolls her eyes playfully) You're a menace, Bob. But you're right, cities <em>are</em> struggling to find effective long-term solutions. It's a massive drain on resources and a humanitarian crisis.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> It just feels so overwhelming, you know? Like, what can <em>anyone</em> even do?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Small steps. Supporting local shelters, advocating for affordable housing policies, educating ourselves. Every little bit helps. It's a marathon, not a sprint.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> A marathon where people are literally running out of places to sleep. Okay, point taken. Maybe I'll start with not trying to pitch my own tent in Central Park.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-text">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> A wise first step, Bob. A very wise first step.
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Homelessness remains a significant and growing challenge in many major U.S. cities. Factors such as a severe shortage of affordable housing, stagnant wages, mental health crises, substance abuse, and the economic fallout from events like the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated the issue. Cities like Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco consistently report some of the highest numbers of unsheltered individuals.</p>
    <p>The problem is multifaceted, encompassing not only those living in visible tent encampments or "sleeping rough" on the streets, but also people living in cars, staying in temporary shelters, or "couch-surfing" with friends or family (often referred to as "hidden homelessness"). Cities are grappling with how to address the immediate crisis, often setting up temporary "safe sleeping sites" or increasing shelter capacity, while simultaneously trying to implement long-term solutions like permanent supportive housing and robust mental health and addiction services. The economic and social costs are immense, making it a critical policy and humanitarian concern.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning, often idiomatic. They are very common in spoken and informal English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pop up:</strong> To appear or occur suddenly or unexpectedly.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> New cafes seem to <em>pop up</em> on every street corner these days.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Set up:</strong> To establish, arrange, or prepare something.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> They decided to <em>set up</em> a charity to help local families.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Run out of:</strong> To completely use up a supply of something so that there is no more left.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> We <em>ran out of</em> milk, so I need to go to the store.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Conditional Sentences (Type 1)</h3>
    <p>Type 1 conditional sentences are used to talk about real and possible situations in the present or future. They express a real possibility. The basic structure is: <strong>If + present simple, ... will/can/may + base verb.</strong> However, the dialogue uses a slight variation with the past simple in the 'if' clause to express a hypothetical but still possible situation that might happen in the future (sometimes called 'future less vivid').</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If I wanted to set up a tent in Central Park, I'd probably get arrested.</strong>
            <p>Here, "If I wanted to..." describes an imagined scenario, and "I'd probably get arrested" (I would probably get arrested) is the likely consequence. Alice's response "You probably would!" reinforces this as a likely outcome if Bob actually tried it.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example (standard Type 1):</em> <em>If it rains tomorrow</em>, we <em>will stay</em> home.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example (dialogue style):</em> <em>If I won the lottery</em>, I <em>might buy</em> an island (a less likely but still possible future event).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Present Perfect Continuous</h3>
    <p>The Present Perfect Continuous tense (<strong>has/have + been + -ing verb</strong>) is used to describe an action that started in the past and is still continuing in the present, or has recently stopped but has a clear result in the present.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The number of people sleeping rough has actually been on the rise in some places.</strong>
            <p>This indicates that the trend of increasing numbers started in the past and is still continuing up to the present moment.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> She <em>has been studying</em> for three hours.</p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> It <em>has been raining</em> all morning.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
