Alice: Bob, guess what? I just saw a calendar! It's almost festival time!
Bob: Alice! Calendar? Are you sure it wasn't a really fancy pizza menu? You're always thinking about food.
Alice: Haha, very funny! No, it really said 'Autumn Festival next month'! What's your favorite festival?
Bob: Oh, an autumn festival! Hmm, my favorite... definitely the 'Sleep-in- until-noon Festival' every weekend. It's a classic.
Alice: That's not a real festival, Bob! I mean a _celebration_ with food and music!
Bob: Okay, okay! If I have to pick a _real_ one, I love the Spring Blossom Festival. All the flowers are beautiful.
Alice: Ah, the Spring Blossom Festival is lovely! My favorite is the 'Food Truck Fiesta' in July. So many delicious smells!
Bob: Of course it is, Alice. Anything with 'food' in the name! Do you remember that time you tried to eat a whole giant pretzel by yourself?
Alice: Hey! I almost did it! It was a _festival_ pretzel! Anyway, what do people usually _do_ at the Spring Blossom Festival?
Bob: Well, they go for picnics under the trees, take lots of photos, and there's often traditional music. It's quite relaxing.
Alice: Sounds nice. At the Food Truck Fiesta, people eat, listen to live bands, and sometimes there are even cooking contests.
Bob: Cooking contests! I bet you're always a judge, right? "Yes, this burger needs more cheese, please!"
Alice: Maybe! Do you ever _dress up_ for festivals?
Bob: Sometimes! For the Halloween festival, I was a zombie last year. It was a bit messy, but fun!
Alice: Oh, Halloween is fun! I was a witch. My hat kept falling off.
Bob: You'd make a great witch, Alice. Just add a giant cauldron for all your festival snacks!
Alice: Alright, Mr. Funny! Are there any festivals you _don't_ like?
Bob: Hmm, I'm not a big fan of the 'Early Morning Marathon Festival.' Too much running, not enough eating.
Alice: Haha, I agree! I don't like festivals where it's too crowded. I can't find the food trucks!
Bob: Priorities, Alice, priorities! So, about this Autumn Festival... what kind of food do you think they'll have?
Alice: Pumpkin pie, apple cider, roasted corn... My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
Bob: Sounds like a plan! We should definitely go together. Maybe I can find a new 'favorite festival' that day.
Alice: Perfect! But only if you promise not to try and eat a flower.
Bob: Deal! Unless it's a giant edible flower made of candy. Then all bets are off!
Alice: You're impossible! See you there, Bob!
Bob: Bye, Alice! Don't eat all the pumpkin pie before I get there!
