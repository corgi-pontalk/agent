        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Oh, hi Bob! Fancy seeing you here. I’m trying to deposit some money.</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> Alice! What a surprise! You look a bit lost, though. Is everything okay?</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Well, I need to deposit money, but this machine looks like a robot from the future.</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> (chuckles) That's the ATM, Alice. For depositing, you usually need to go inside or use the deposit function if it has one.</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Inside? But there's a huge line! Can't I just throw the money into that slot? (points to a random slot)</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> (laughs loudly) No, Alice, please don't! That's probably for mail. We need to get a deposit slip or use the teller.</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> A deposit slip? Is it a secret handshake for the money?</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> (shaking his head, smiling) Not exactly. It's a small paper form. You write your account number and the amount. Come on, I’ll show you.</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Okay, Mr. Banking Expert. Lead the way! Is it in that pile of pens?</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> (sighs dramatically) No, it's usually near the counter. Ah, here we go. See?</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Oh! It's so small. My handwriting is terrible. What if they can't read "fifty dollars"?</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> They'll figure it out. Just write clearly. And make sure your account number is correct.</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Okay, okay. Done! Now, do I give it to the robot or the person with the nice smile?</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> The person with the nice smile, Alice. That’s the bank teller.</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Thank goodness! She looks much friendlier than the money-eating robot. Thanks, Bob! You saved me from a banking disaster!</p>
        <p><b>Bob:</b> Any time, Alice. Now, how about we get out of this financial jungle and grab some coffee?</p>
        <p><b>Alice:</b> Sounds like a brilliant plan! My brain needs a break from numbers.</p>
