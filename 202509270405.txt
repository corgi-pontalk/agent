Alice : Oh, _Bob_! Fancy meeting you here! Are you ordering? Bob : _Alice_! Wow, what a surprise! Yes, I am. But this menu... it's so long! My brain is doing a dance. Alice : (Giggles) Looks like it's doing the cha-cha. What are you thinking of getting? Bob : I don't know! Everything sounds good. Uhm, _excuse me_ , waiter? Waiter : Yes, sir? Bob : (Panicked) Uh, _could I_... _could I_ maybe have... a moment? My decision-making skills are on vacation. Waiter : Of course, sir. Just let me know when you're ready. (Smiles patiently) Alice : (Whispering to Bob) Relax! Just pick something you like. Try "_I'd like_..." Bob : Okay, okay. Deep breaths. _Excuse me_! Waiter : Ready, sir? Bob : Yes! _I'd like_... the giant pepperoni pizza, _please_. With extra cheese. And a diet soda. No, wait! Make that a chocolate milkshake! _Please and thank you_. Alice : (Shakes head, smiling) Oh Bob. You're never simple. I'll go next. _Excuse me, could I please have_ the Caesar salad? And a small orange juice? Waiter : _Certainly, ma'am_. Anything else for you two? Alice : _That's all for me, thank you_. Bob : Yes, just... just the pizza and the milkshake. _Please_. _Thank you_ so much! You're a lifesaver. Waiter : (Chuckles) _My pleasure_. I'll be right back with your drinks.
