    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Hey Bob, did you see the rumors about the Pixel 10? My old phone just *died* on me this morning, so I'm already eyeing a replacement!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice! You're always on top of the latest tech news, even when your phone isn't. Yeah, I caught a glimpse. Sounds wild, doesn't it? All that talk about its AI being practically sentient.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Sentient might be an understatement! They say it'll anticipate your needs before you even realize you have them. Like, "Good morning, Alice. I've already ordered your usual latte and booked a spin class for 7 PM. You're welcome."</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Oh, man. Imagine it finishing your sentences for you. "I'm thinking of having..." *BEEP BOOP* "Pizza, Bob. With extra pepperoni. I've already ordered it. It'll be here in 15 minutes." That's less of a personal assistant and more of a personal dictator!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Exactly! And the privacy implications? "Alice, I noticed you spent 3 hours scrolling through cat videos last night. Perhaps we should optimize your sleep schedule?" No, Pixel, you mind your own business!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: But think of the convenience! Never forgetting an anniversary again because your phone *remembers* it better than you do. It could even write the apology card for you!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: True, it could be a game-changer for forgetful folks. "Bob, your mother called. She's disappointed you haven't visited. I've booked you a flight and sent flowers."</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Okay, now that's a bit much. I'd have to draw the line somewhere. What if it starts judging my questionable late-night snack choices? "Bob, another bag of chips? For your health, I've swapped them for kale chips."</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Haha! See, that's where the "overstepping its boundaries" part comes in. Though, if it could figure out why I always lose my keys... that would be mind-blowing.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Mine would just say, "Alice, you put them in the fridge again, didn't you?" And it would be right. It's almost scary how powerful on-device AI is becoming.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: It is. But I can't deny the allure. My current phone is barely holding a charge. If the Pixel 10 can predict my next coffee craving *and* find my keys, I might just jump on the bandwagon.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Hold your horses, Alice. Let's wait for the official reveal. It might not be as omniscient as the rumors suggest. Or it might be even more so, and we'll all be living under benevolent AI phone overlords.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: A benevolent AI phone overlord sounds better than my current phone that thinks "low battery" is a lifestyle choice. I'm optimistically terrified!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Optimistically terrified â€“ I love that! Well, let me know if your Pixel 10 AI ever tries to schedule your dentist appointment *for* you. I need to know what future we're heading into.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Will do! Or, more likely, it'll just text you itself: "Bob, Alice is busy, but she'd like you to know she's contemplating world domination with me. Cheers, Pixel 10."</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The landscape of smartphone technology is rapidly evolving, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration at its forefront. Google's Pixel line, known for its cutting-edge camera technology and "pure Android" experience, has historically been a pioneer in on-device AI, largely powered by its custom-designed Tensor chips. These chips enable advanced computational photography, real-time language processing (like Live Translate), and sophisticated contextual awareness without relying solely on cloud processing.</p>
    <p>While specific details about the hypothetical "Pixel 10" are purely speculative at this stage, the trend indicates an even deeper integration of generative AI features. Future Pixel phones are expected to leverage AI for more intuitive user interfaces, proactive assistance (predicting user needs, optimizing tasks), hyper-personalized experiences, and enhanced privacy controls for on-device processing. This move aims to make smartphones not just tools, but highly intelligent and adaptive companions, blurring the lines between a personal device and an advanced digital assistant. The dialogue above playfully explores these potential (and sometimes comical) future scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h4>1. Phrasal Verbs</h4>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that, when combined, create a new meaning that is often different from the individual words. They are very common in informal English conversations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>die on (someone)</b>: To stop working suddenly, especially for electronic devices.
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue:</i> My old phone just <b>died on</b> me this morning.</div></li>
                    <li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Another example:</i> My car <b>died on</b> me in the middle of the highway.</div></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>eyeing (something)</b>: To look at something with interest, often with the intention of acquiring it.
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue:</i> I'm already <b>eyeing</b> a replacement!</div></li>
                    <li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Another example:</i> She was <b>eyeing</b> the last piece of cake on the table.</div></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>catch a glimpse</b>: To see something briefly or partially. (This is a multi-word verb phrase, often functions similarly to a phrasal verb in terms of meaning shift).
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue:</i> Yeah, I <b>caught a glimpse</b>.</div></li>
                    <li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Another example:</i> I just <b>caught a glimpse</b> of a shooting star!</div></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>figure out</b>: To understand or solve something.
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue:</i> Though, if it could <b>figure out</b> why I always lose my keys...</div></li>
                    <li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Another example:</i> I can't <b>figure out</b> how to use this new software.</div></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>hold a charge</b>: (For a battery) to maintain its power for a period of time.
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue:</i> My current phone is barely <b>holding a charge</b>.</div></li>
                    <li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Another example:</i> This old laptop battery doesn't <b>hold a charge</b> anymore.</div></li></ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Modal Verbs for Speculation</h4>
        <p>Modal verbs (like <i>might, could, may, must, should, will</i>) are used to express various degrees of certainty, possibility, and probability. In the dialogue, Alice and Bob use them to speculate about the future features of the Pixel 10.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>might / could / may</b>: Used to express possibility or uncertainty (less certain).
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue:</i> Sentient <b>might</b> be an understatement!</div></li>

            <li><b>will</b>: Used to express a strong prediction or certainty about the future.
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue:</i> They say it'll anticipate your needs... (<i>'ll is a contraction of will</i>)</div></li>
                    <li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Another example:</i> I think he <b>will</b> win the election.</div></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>should</b>: Used to express expectation or probability, or what is advisable.
                <ul><li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Example from dialogue (implied):</i> "Perhaps we <b>should</b> optimize your sleep schedule?" (AI suggesting an action)</div></li>
                    <li><div class="example-sentence"><i>Another example:</i> The train <b>should</b> arrive any minute now.</div></li></ul>
            </li>
