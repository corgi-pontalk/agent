    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, did you hear about the new 'Pandemic Preparedness Day' initiative? I swear, it sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! I saw an article about it. Are we supposed to be stocking up on *more* toilet paper, or has the strategy evolved?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Apparently, it's less about the toilet paper hoard and more about, you know, vaccine equity and early warning systems. The boring but important stuff.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Ah, the 'sensible' approach. My personal pandemic preparedness plan involves mastering sourdough and binge-watching everything on streaming services. Very effective for mental resilience.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> That's one way to look at it! But seriously, after what we've been through, I can see why they're pushing for better global coordination.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Definitely. Remember when hand sanitizer became a luxury item? My hands were so dry, they looked like ancient scrolls.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Mine too! And trying to explain 'social distancing' to my grandma via video call was an Olympic sport.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> The struggle was real. But I guess the idea is to prevent that level of chaos next time, right? Early detection, rapid response, all that jazz.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly. They're talking about investing in 'disease surveillance' networks. Sounds a bit like we're always being watched, but for a good cause.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> So, less 'Big Brother is watching' and more 'Big Brother is making sure you don't accidentally start a zombie apocalypse'? I can get behind that.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Pretty much! And apparently, international cooperation is a huge part of it. No country is an island when it comes to a global health crisis.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> True. It's like a worldwide group project, and we're all hoping nobody slacks off on their part. Especially the data sharing part.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Let's hope not. Imagine if we'd had all this in place *before* the last one. Maybe my sourdough wouldn't have been quite so... experimental.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Your sourdough was a national treasure, Alice. But yes, faster development of countermeasures and equitable distribution would be amazing.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> And fewer Zoom quizzes! Though I do miss our themed costume ones.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Okay, maybe *some* Zoom quizzes are okay, if they're voluntary. But definitely more prepared for the *next* thing. Let's just hope 'the next thing' isn't alien invasion.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The recent global pandemic underscored critical vulnerabilities in public health systems worldwide. In response, there's a significant push for enhanced global pandemic preparedness and response (PPR). International bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO), G7, and G20 are advocating for stronger frameworks, increased investment in disease surveillance, and better coordination. The focus is on strengthening early warning systems, ensuring equitable access to vaccines and treatments, boosting research and development (R&D) for countermeasures, and building resilient health infrastructures. The aim is to move from a reactive approach to a proactive, globally coordinated strategy to prevent future health crises from escalating into full-blown pandemics, while also addressing the socio-economic impacts.</p>

        <h3>1. Phrasal Verbs: "Stock up on" and "Get behind"</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with a preposition or an adverb (or both) to create a new meaning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>stock up on something:</strong> to buy a lot of something so that you have enough for a period of time.

        <h3>2. Conditional Sentences (Type 3 - Imaginary Past)</h3>
        <p>These sentences talk about hypothetical situations in the past and their hypothetical results. They describe what *would have happened* if something *different had happened*.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> If + Past Perfect (had + V3), would/could/might + have + Past Participle (V3)</p>

        <p><span class="note">Explanation:</span> Alice is imagining a different past – if they *had possessed* preparedness measures, her sourdough *would not have been* as experimental (implying less time for baking due to less chaos).</p>
        <p><span class="note">Another Example:</span> <em>If I <strong>had known</strong> you were coming, I <strong>would have baked</strong> a cake.</em> (But I didn't know, so I didn't bake one.)</p>
