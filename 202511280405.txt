Alice : Hey Bob, guess what? I'm going on a business trip! Bob : Oh, Alice! That's... exciting? Where are you off to, a fancy resort or a cubicle farm in Ohio? Alice : Ha! Very funny. It's actually to Singapore. Bob : Singapore! Wow, lucky you! Don't forget my souvenir durian. Kidding! Alice : Durian? No way! I'm already stressed about packing. Do I need formal wear or just my pajamas? Bob : Depends on the meetings. But definitely pack some comfy shoes. You'll be walking a lot, or running from angry durian vendors. Alice : You're not helping! This is my first time traveling for work. I'm a bit nervous. Bob : Don't worry too much. A business trip is mostly just work in a different place. But with hotel shampoo! Alice : True, hotel shampoo is a luxury. But what if I forget something important? My passport, my laptop... Bob : Make a checklist! And double-check everything. Like, three times. I once forgot my toothbrush. Not fun. Alice : Ugh, I can imagine. So, any actual useful advice, Mr. Globetrotter? Bob : Alright, alright. Seriously, try to enjoy the new place a little if you can. And remember to try local food! Just maybe not the durian. Alice : Thanks, Bob. I'll try. And I promise to send you postcards of all the weird food I eat. Bob : Perfect! Have a great trip, Alice! Alice : Thanks! Wish me luck!
