    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, guess what I did today?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, tell me! Did you finally start your own amazing... <em>cupcake empire</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Even better! I tried to help my uncle with his <strong>marketing</strong> for his new pet rock business.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Pet rocks? Alice, are you serious? That's a challenging <strong>product</strong>!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! He thinks everyone will be a <strong>customer</strong>. I told him we need a <strong>target audience</strong>. Maybe people who really miss their old pet rocks?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Good point! So, what was your big marketing idea? Did you <strong>advertise</strong> on a tiny rock-sized billboard?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha, not quite! I suggested a <strong>promotion</strong>. Buy one pet rock, get a free tiny leash!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A leash for a rock? That's... unique. What about a <strong>brand name</strong> and a <strong>slogan</strong>?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: We're working on 'Rocky & Friends: Your Unbreakable Companion!' for the <strong>brand</strong>. And the slogan is 'Always there, never sheds!'</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Never sheds! I love it! That's a strong <strong>campaign</strong> right there.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: He even wants a <strong>logo</strong>. I suggested a happy rock with googly eyes.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perfect! You're a natural at this, Alice. Maybe we should open our own marketing agency for quirky products.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Only if you handle the <strong>sales</strong> calls, Bob. My voice isn't ready for convincing people they need a rock.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Deal! So, when do we launch the 'Buy 10, get 1 free' <strong>sale</strong>?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Slow down, superstar! We need to analyze the <strong>market</strong> first. And maybe give the pet rocks tiny hats.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Tiny hats... brilliant! This is going to be huge!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Let's hope so. My uncle is counting on us to make his pet rocks famous!</p>

        <ul>
