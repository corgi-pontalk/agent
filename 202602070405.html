    <h1>Dialogue</h1>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what? I just remembered my old high school uniform. So many pleats!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, Alice! Don't even get me started. Mine was a tie that always felt like it was trying to choke me. What a system!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Right? And the early mornings... my brain felt like it was still asleep until lunch.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Totally! It's funny how different schools can be, even in the same city. My cousin went to a school that started at 10 AM. Can you believe it?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Wow, 10 AM? That sounds like a dream! We had to be there by 7:30 AM. It felt like a military academy.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Haha, I know what you mean. Did you have a lot of homework every night?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, yes! Especially in math. I used to stare at the textbook for hours, pretending to understand calculus.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Calculus! You brave soul. I just copied my friend's answers sometimes. Don't tell anyone!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob! You're terrible! But I guess everyone finds ways to survive the school system.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Like, why did we have to learn ancient history if we're never going to be archaeologists?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good point! But then again, I did learn to bake a pretty good apple pie in home economics. That was useful!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: See? Some classes *were* practical. What about exams? Did you hate them?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Absolutely! The pressure! I always felt like my brain was going to explode during a big test.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Mine too! It's like the whole education system was designed to test how well we could memorize things for one day.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Maybe! But hey, at least we made it through. Now we can complain about it together!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: True that! High five for surviving!</p>

    <h1>Current Situation</h1>
    <p>Education systems are how countries organize learning for children and adults. They include everything from kindergarten to university. Most countries have public schools, which are free or low-cost, and private schools, which cost money. There are also different levels: <strong>primary school</strong> (for young children), <strong>secondary school</strong> (for teenagers), and <strong>higher education</strong> (like college or university).</p>
    <p>The main goal of an education system is to help people learn important skills, gain knowledge, and develop critical thinking. Sometimes, schools focus on practical skills (like baking, as Alice mentioned in the dialogue!), and sometimes on academic subjects (like history or math). Every system has its own rules and ways of doing things, such as when school starts, how much homework is given, and how exams are conducted.</p>

    <h1>Grammar Points</h1>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Simple Past Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the <strong>Simple Past tense</strong> to talk about actions or states that happened at a specific time in the past and are now finished.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + Verb (past form)</li>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I <strong>remembered</strong> my old high school uniform." (remember &rarr; remembered)</li>
                    <li>"My brain <strong>felt</strong> like it was still asleep." (feel &rarr; felt)</li>
                    <li>"My cousin <strong>went</strong> to a school." (go &rarr; went)</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Subject + did not (didn't) + base form of verb. (e.g., "I <strong>didn't like</strong> it.")</li>
            <li><strong>Questions:</strong> Did + Subject + base form of verb? (e.g., "<strong>Did</strong> you <strong>have</strong> homework?")</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Used to</h3>
        <p>We use <strong>"used to"</strong> to talk about habits or states that were true regularly in the past but are no longer true now.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form:</strong> Subject + used to + base form of verb.</li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I <strong>used to stare</strong> at the textbook for hours." (Meaning: I did this regularly in the past, but I don't now.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Subject + didn't use to + base form of verb. (e.g., "I <strong>didn't use to like</strong> vegetables.")</li>
            <li><strong>Questions:</strong> Did + Subject + use to + base form of verb? (e.g., "<strong>Did</strong> you <strong>use to play</strong> sports?")</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Question Words (What, Why, Did)</h3>
        <p>These words help us ask for specific information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What:</strong> Asks for information about a thing or action.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: "<strong>What</strong> a system!" "<strong>What</strong> about exams?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> Asks for the reason.

                    <li>Example: "Like, <strong>why</strong> did we have to learn ancient history?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Example: "<strong>Did</strong> you have a lot of homework?" "<strong>Did</strong> you hate them?"</li>
