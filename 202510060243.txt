Alice : Oh, Bob! Is that you? I didn't expect to see you here! Bob : Alice! My hero! Yes, it's me. I'm on a quest for the legendary 'Cold Slayer' medicine. My nose feels like a leaky faucet, and my head is a drum solo. Alice : A 'Cold Slayer'? Are you sure it's not just a regular cold? You always get so dramatic. Bob : Dramatic? This is serious, Alice! I need something for my sore throat, too. It feels like I swallowed a cactus. Alice : Okay, okay. Let's find something. Have you asked the pharmacist for advice? Bob : Not yet. I was admiring the colorful bandages. Do you think a glittery one would make me feel better? Alice : Probably not for a sore throat, Bob. Look, there's the pharmacist. Let's go ask her. Bob : But what should I say? My voice is so hoarse! Alice : Just tell her your symptoms. "Hello, I have a sore throat and a runny nose." Easy. Bob : Right. "Hello, kind dispenser of healing elixirs! My nasal passages are in rebellion and my vocal cords are staging a protest!" Alice : (whispering) Bob, just "Hello, I have a sore throat and a runny nose." Pharmacist : Can I help you? Bob : (clears throat dramatically) Yes, I have a sore throat and a runny nose, and my head... Alice : (interjecting smoothly) And he's looking for some medicine for a common cold. Something for the throat and nose. Pharmacist : I see. We have a good syrup for sore throats and nasal sprays for runny noses. Would you like a pain reliever for your head too? Bob : A pain reliever! Yes! My head is a rock concert! Alice : (to Bob) Okay, let's get the syrup, the spray, and some pain relievers. You'll be fine. Bob : Thank you, Alice. You saved my life. Or at least my weekend. Alice : You're welcome. And next time, maybe just a cough drop for your 'cactus throat'.
