        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, what are you up to this weekend? Any exciting plans, or just more homework?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Good to see you! This weekend? Hmm, I'm going to conquer the mountain of dirty dishes in my sink. It's a truly epic quest.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Sounds thrilling! After that monumental task, what about your *actual* future plans? Like, next month?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Next month? I'm going to invent a self-cleaning dish machine, obviously. Then, I'm going to relax. A lot.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Dream big, Bob! I'm planning to visit my aunt in the countryside. It's less dramatic, but at least there are no dishes.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Good point! I'm also thinking about learning to cook something beyond instant noodles. My stomach deserves better.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> That's a great plan! What kind of food are you going to try?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I'm going to attempt... a gourmet sandwich. Baby steps, Alice, baby steps.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I like your ambition! I'm going to start a new book. A really thick one. I'm going to finish it by the end of the month.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Wow, a book *and* a visit? You're busy! Are you going to travel anywhere next year?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I would like to visit Japan next year. I'm saving up for it!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Japan sounds amazing! I'm going to try to save up for... a new coffee machine. Priorities, you know.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ha! Well, a good coffee machine is important for big plans! We should grab coffee next week to discuss our future empires.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Definitely! I'm free on Tuesday. I'll text you.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Perfect! See you then, Bob!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Bye, Alice!</p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Present Continuous for Definite Future Arrangements</strong>
                <p>We can use the present continuous tense (am/is/are + verb-ing) to talk about future plans that are already definite arrangements, especially when a time or date is mentioned.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + am/is/are + verb-ing</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>

            </li>
            <li><strong>"Would Like To" for Desires and Wishes</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + would like to + verb (base form)</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
