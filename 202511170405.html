    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, hi Bob! Just dreaming about roller coasters.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Roller coasters? Alice, you always say they're too fast!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, maybe this time I'm brave! Or hungry for churros.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Churros are a great reason! Have you been to Funland recently?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Not for ages! Is it still good?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It's fantastic! They have a new ride. It's called 'The Vomit Comet'.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: The <em>what</em>?! That doesn't sound very fun, Bob!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Haha, it's not really called that! It's 'Star Rider'. But it feels like a comet when you ride it.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, you almost got me! Is it really scary?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A little! But the view from the top is amazing. And then you drop! Wooosh!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: "Wooosh" sounds like a good way to lose your lunch.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Don't worry, they have a "no-churros-before-ride" rule. Just kidding!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe we should go. But I'll bring an extra-large bucket... just in case.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perfect! I'll buy the tickets. You just bring your bravery... and maybe the bucket.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Deal! But I'm going for the churros first.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. The Present Continuous (e.g., "I'm dreaming", "What are you doing?")</h3>
        <p>We use the <strong>Present Continuous</strong> to talk about actions happening <strong>now</strong> or around the time of speaking. It helps describe things that are in progress.</p>
        <p><strong>Form:</strong> <code>Subject + is/am/are + verb-ing</code></p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I <strong>am dreaming</strong> about food. (This is happening now)</li>
            <li>She <strong>is eating</strong> an apple. (She is doing it at this moment)</li>
            <li>They <strong>are playing</strong> outside. (Their action is ongoing)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Adjectives (e.g., "fast", "scary", "amazing")</h3>
        <p><strong>Adjectives</strong> are words that describe nouns (people, places, things, ideas). They tell us more about the noun, giving us details like size, color, or feeling.</p>
        <p><strong>Placement:</strong> Adjectives usually come <strong>before the noun</strong> they describe. They can also come after linking verbs like 'is', 'are', 'looks', 'feels', 'sounds'.</p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's a <strong>fast</strong> car. ('fast' describes 'car')</li>
            <li>That was a <strong>scary</strong> movie. ('scary' describes 'movie')</li>
            <li>The view is <strong>amazing</strong>. ('amazing' describes 'view', coming after 'is')</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
