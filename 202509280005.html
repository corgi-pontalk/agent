    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, did you see that article? They're letting <em>robots</em> decide who goes to jail!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Whoa, Alice, 'robots' is a bit dramatic, isn't it? It's more like AI algorithms helping judges.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Same difference! Next thing you know, we'll have RoboCop as a prosecutor and a Roomba as a jury. 'Guilty! For leaving crumbs on the floor!'
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Haha, I'm sure it's not that extreme. They use AI for things like predicting recidivism, or analyzing evidence faster.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Recidivism? So, AI decides if you're <em>likely</em> to re-offend? What if I just have a perpetually grumpy face? Will AI tag me as a potential menace?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> That's a fair point about bias. There are definitely concerns about AI reflecting existing societal biases in its data.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly! Imagine 'Judge AI-fred' saying, 'Based on your coffee order history, you exhibit chaotic tendencies. Ten years for reckless latte-making!'
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Okay, that's hilarious. But the idea is to make the system more efficient, not less fair. Think about sifting through mountains of evidence.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> True, I guess. No more dusty old files, just instant data analysis. 'Your honor, the AI has concluded the defendant's alibi is statistically improbable due to their known love for Tuesdays at the arcade.'
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> See? It could speed things up significantly. Less backlog, quicker trials.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> But what if it makes a mistake? Can you appeal to a supercomputer? 'Error 404: Justice Not Found'?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> That's why humans are still in charge. The AI is a tool, a <em>support system</em>, not the final decision-maker. At least, that's the current goal.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> For now. I'm just picturing a future where AI handles everything, and we're all just trying to guess what data points it's judging us on.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Maybe we just need to be extra polite to our smart home devices. Just in case they're collecting 'good citizen' data.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Good point, Bob! I'm off to apologize to my toaster for burning my breakfast.
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into criminal justice systems worldwide, offering both promise and challenges. AI applications range from predictive policing, which uses data to anticipate crime hotspots, to risk assessment tools that evaluate a defendant's likelihood of re-offending (recidivism). It also assists in sifting through vast amounts of evidence, analyzing documents, audio, and video more efficiently than humans.</p>
    <p>Proponents highlight AI's potential to enhance efficiency, reduce case backlogs, and identify patterns that might be missed by human analysts. However, significant concerns exist regarding bias, as AI algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases present in their training data. Transparency and accountability are also major ethical considerations, as the complex nature of AI decisions can make it difficult to understand how conclusions are reached, potentially compromising fairness and due process.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>predicting recidivism</strong>: The act of forecasting whether a person will re-offend after being released from prison or completing a sentence.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: AI algorithms are often used for <em>predicting recidivism</em>, to help judges make informed decisions about sentencing and parole.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>sifting through mountains of evidence</strong>: To examine a very large amount of information carefully and thoroughly to find something specific.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Law enforcement can use AI for <em>sifting through mountains of evidence</em> in complex fraud cases.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>statistically improbable</strong>: Very unlikely to happen based on statistical analysis or probability.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: The defense argued that the prosecution's timeline was <em>statistically improbable</em> given the defendant's alibi.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>backlog</strong>: A large quantity of work that needs to be done but has not yet been done.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: AI could help reduce the huge <em>backlog</em> of cases in the court system, speeding up justice.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>support system</strong>: A network of people or things that provides encouragement, assistance, and guidance.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: The AI is designed to be a <em>support system</em> for judges, not to replace them entirely in decision-making.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>data points</strong>: Individual pieces of information or facts collected about a subject.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: It's important to understand what <em>data points</em> an AI uses to make its recommendations to ensure fairness.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>perpetually grumpy face</strong>: A face that always looks unhappy or annoyed. (Used humorously in the dialogue)
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Don't worry, having a <em>perpetually grumpy face</em> won't automatically make you a suspect, even to an AI!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Question Tags</h3>
            <p>Question tags are short questions added to the end of a statement. They are used to confirm information or to invite agreement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the main statement is positive, the tag is usually negative: "It's a bit dramatic, <strong>isn't it</strong>?"</li>
                <li>If the main statement is negative, the tag is usually positive: "AI can't replace human judges entirely, <strong>can it</strong>?"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Conditional Sentences (Type 1 & 2)</h3>
            <p>Conditional sentences express a condition and its result. The dialogue uses both Type 1 (real future possibilities) and Type 2 (hypothetical or unreal situations).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type 1 (Real Conditional)</strong>: Used for a real or very probable situation in the present or future.
                    <p class="example-sentence">Structure: If + Present Simple, will/can/may + Base Verb</p>
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "What if I just have a perpetually grumpy face? <strong>Will AI tag me</strong> as a potential menace?"</p>
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: "If we don't address AI bias, it <strong>will lead</strong> to unfair judgments."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Type 2 (Unreal Conditional)</strong>: Used for hypothetical or improbable situations in the present or future.
                    <p class="example-sentence">Structure: If + Past Simple, would/could/might + Base Verb</p>
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue (implied future hypothetical): "I'm just picturing a future where AI handles everything, and we're all just trying to guess what data points it's judging us on." (Could be rephrased: "If AI handled everything, we would all be guessing...")</p>
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: "If I <strong>were</strong> a judge, I <strong>would rely</strong> on AI for initial evidence screening."</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Phrasal Verb: "Sift through"</h3>
            <p>A phrasal verb is a verb combined with an adverb or a preposition, or sometimes both, to create a new meaning.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sift through</strong>: To examine a collection of things very carefully in order to find something, or to separate the useful things from the less useful ones.
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example from dialogue: "Think about <strong>sifting through mountains of evidence</strong>."</p>
                    <p class="example-sentence">Example: The detective had to <em>sift through</em> hundreds of witness statements to find inconsistencies.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
