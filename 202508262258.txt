Alice: Bob, guess how many popcorn kernels I just counted in this bag!
Bob: Alice, you counted them? Seriously? My guess is... oh, let's say, seventy-three?
Alice: Seventy-three? Way off! It's exactly ninety-nine!
Bob: Ninety-nine? Wow, that's almost a hundred. Are you sure you didn't miss one?
Alice: Positive! I even double-checked. My eyesight is twenty-twenty, remember?
Bob: Right, right. So, if we have ninety-nine kernels, and there are two of us... that's forty-nine and a half each. Unfair!
Alice: Don't be dramatic. I was just illustrating a point. We're having a movie night, and I need you to grab some snacks. How many bags of chips do we need for five people?
Bob: Five people... so, uh, five bags? One each?
Alice: Are you new to snack allocation? We need at least two bags per person, so that's ten bags total. Plus, maybe three extra for emergencies.
Bob: Ten plus three... thirteen bags of chips. My car can barely fit thirteen bags of anything!
Alice: Okay, maybe twelve then. And two large sodas. Oh, and how many boxes of those mini chocolates did you say you wanted? Like, fifty?
Bob: Fifty mini chocolates? I said five! F-I-V-E! You're trying to bankrupt me, Alice!
Alice: Oops, my bad! My ears must be twenty-twenty, but my memory is fifty- fifty sometimes. Just get five boxes, then.
Bob: And don't forget the twelve bags of chips. This is going to cost at least forty-seven dollars.
Alice: Alright, bargain hunter. See you in twenty minutes!
