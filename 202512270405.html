    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hi Bob! You look like you just saw a ghost. What's up?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Oh, hey. I'm just practicing for my first real business phone call. I need to sound super professional.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>Super</em> professional? Bob, you usually sound like a sleepy bear.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Exactly! That's the problem. I need to make a good impression. I even practiced saying, "Good morning, this is Bob speaking."</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>[holding back laughter]</em> "This is Bob speaking." Very formal. Are you going to wear a tiny suit for your phone?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Don't laugh! It's important. What if they ask to speak to Mr. Robert? Should I say, "That's me, but my friends call me Bob"?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> No, no! Just "This is he." Or "Speaking." Don't bring your friends into a business call. Unless they're clients.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Right. "This is he." Got it. And what if I need to <em>transfer</em> a call? Do I just yell, "Hey, Sarah! Phone for you!"?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>[groans playfully]</em> No! You'd say, "Please hold while I connect you." Or "One moment, please." Then you press the transfer button.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, there's a button! I thought it was all magic. What if I get a wrong number?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Then you say, "I'm sorry, you have the wrong number." Politely! Don't just hang up.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> What if they ask me to <em>spell</em> something? My name, for example? B-O-B. Is that professional enough?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Perfectly fine. Just don't spell it B-O-B, the builder. Unless you <em>are</em> Bob the Builder.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> <em>[chuckles]</em> Okay, okay. You're right. I'm overthinking this. But thanks for the tips, Alice!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Any time, Bob. Just remember: breathe, be polite, and don't bark into the phone. You'll be great!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Even in today's digital world with emails and video conferences, business phone calls remain a vital part of communication. They require a specific etiquette and set of phrases to ensure clarity, professionalism, and politeness. Unlike face-to-face meetings or video calls, you can't rely on visual cues, so your tone of voice and choice of words become even more important. Mastering basic business phone call phrases can help you make a good impression and communicate effectively in various professional settings, whether you're talking to colleagues, clients, or suppliers.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Polite Requests with "May I" and "Could you"</h3>
            <p>We use "May I" and "Could you" to make polite requests or ask for permission, especially in formal or business settings. "May I" is for asking permission (can I do something?), and "Could you" is for asking someone else to do something.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>May I + base verb:</strong> <br>
                    <span class="example-sentence">Example: "<strong>May I speak</strong> to the manager?" (Asking permission to speak)</span><br>
                    <span class="example-sentence">Example: "<strong>May I help</strong> you?" (Offering help)</span>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Could you + base verb:</strong> <br>
                    <span class="example-sentence">Example: "<strong>Could you spell</strong> your name, please?" (Asking someone to spell)</span><br>
                    <span class="example-sentence">Example: "<strong>Could you transfer</strong> me to extension 200?" (Asking someone to transfer)</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Using "Please" for Politeness</h3>
            <p>"Please" is a simple but powerful word to make any request or instruction more polite. You can place it at the beginning or end of a sentence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="example-sentence">Example: "<strong>Please hold</strong>."</span></li>
                <li><span class="example-sentence">Example: "One moment, <strong>please</strong>."</span></li>
                <li><span class="example-sentence">Example: "Could you repeat that, <strong>please</strong>?"</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>The Present Simple for Self-Introduction and Facts</h3>
            <p>When you answer the phone or introduce yourself, you often use the Present Simple tense. It's used to state facts or current situations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="example-sentence">Example: "Hello, <strong>this is</strong> Bob speaking." (Fact: who is speaking)</span></li>
                <li><span class="example-sentence">Example: "<strong>I am</strong> calling from ABC Company." (Fact: who you are and where you're calling from)</span></li>
                <li><span class="example-sentence">Example: "You <strong>have</strong> the wrong number." (Fact: about the number)</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
