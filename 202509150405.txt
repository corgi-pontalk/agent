Alice : Bob, why do you look so _grumpy_ today? Are you _angry_? Bob : Angry? No, Alice! I'm just _hungry_! My stomach is _sad_. Alice : Hungry? Oh, I thought you were _upset_ about something. You look so serious! Bob : Serious? Maybe a little _tired_ too. I didn't sleep much. But mostly hungry. What about you? You look _happy_! Alice : I am _happy_! I just got a new puppy! I'm so _excited_! Bob : A puppy? Wow! That's amazing! I'm a bit _jealous_ now, haha! Alice : You're _jealous_? Don't be! You can come visit him! He's very _playful_. Bob : Really? That makes me _happy_ to hear! My day is already getting better. See, no more _grumpy_ face! Alice : Good! Sometimes I feel so _stressed_ when I have a lot of homework. Bob : Me too! Sometimes I get really _frustrated_ when my computer crashes. Alice : Oh, I know that feeling! That makes me feel so _annoyed_. Bob : Exactly! But then I just take a deep breath. Or eat something. Like now! Alice : Haha, yes! Let's get some food then. I'm starting to feel a little _hungry_ myself now. Bob : Great idea! I'm _relieved_ to hear that. My stomach will be _ecstatic_! Alice : Ecstatic? You're so dramatic, Bob! But yes, let's go!
