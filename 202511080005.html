        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, have you seen the price of avocados lately? It's like they're gold!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, tell me about it! I saw a documentary last night, and now I'm convinced we'll be trading kale for diamonds in a few decades.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Kale for diamonds? You're being dramatic! But seriously, with all these weird weather patterns, I'm starting to worry about our future Sunday brunches.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Imagine a world where a fresh tomato is a rare delicacy, only found in exclusive, climate-controlled bunkers. My pasta primavera dreams would be shattered!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Or where your 'farm-to-table' meal involves a tiny hydroponic basil plant you grew yourself under a desk lamp. Talk about shrinking your carbon footprint!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: My carbon footprint would be the least of my worries! I'd be more concerned about my 'food print' – how much actual food I can get my hands on. They say insects are the protein of the future, you know.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, please don't even joke about cricket smoothies. I draw the line at anything with more than four legs on my plate, unless it's a very tiny, very dead shrimp.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: But think about it, Alice! Droughts are wiping out crops, floods are ruining harvests... what if chocolate becomes extinct? That's a true apocalypse for me.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Okay, now you've got my attention. No chocolate? That's a future I refuse to accept. We need to start stockpiling cacao beans immediately!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right? We'll be like doomsday preppers, but for gourmet food. My bunker will have artisanal cheeses and organic coffee beans. Yours?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Mine will be dedicated entirely to pasta, different sauces, and a lifetime supply of fresh bread. Oh, and a fridge just for desserts. No room for insects, thank you very much.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Sounds like a plan! We should probably learn to grow our own super-resilient, climate-proof potatoes in the meantime. Just in case.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good idea. I'll take the potatoes, you can try cultivating those 'future protein' insects. We can call it our 'Ark of Appetite' project.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Deal! But if my insects start escaping, you're responsible for the extermination. I'm only good for the theoretical planning and consumption.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It's a deal, Bob. Now, about those avocado prices... maybe we should just grow an avocado tree in your backyard. Problem solved, right?</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Food security means that all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Climate change poses a significant threat to global food security.</p>
        <p>Rising global temperatures lead to more frequent and intense extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves, which directly impact agricultural productivity. These events can destroy crops, reduce yields, and disrupt supply chains. Additionally, changes in rainfall patterns, increased pest and disease outbreaks, and soil degradation further jeopardize the ability to produce enough food.</p>
        <p>The consequences include higher food prices, increased hunger, malnutrition, and potential social unrest or forced migration. To combat this, efforts are focused on developing climate-resilient crops, adopting sustainable farming practices, reducing food waste, and improving early warning systems for farmers.</p>

    <div class="grammar-box">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 and Type 2)</h3>
        <p>Conditional sentences discuss hypothetical situations and their possible outcomes. They often use 'if'.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1 Conditional (Real/Likely Conditions):</strong> Used for situations that are real or very likely to happen in the present or future.
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure: If + Present Simple, Will + Base Verb</li>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "But <strong>if my insects start escaping, you're responsible</strong> for the extermination." (Here, 'you're responsible' functions as the consequence, using Present Simple for a general truth or immediate consequence).</li>
                    <li><em>Another example:</em> "What <strong>if chocolate becomes extinct? That's a true apocalypse</strong> for me."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Conditional (Unreal/Hypothetical Conditions):</strong> Used for situations that are unreal, unlikely, or impossible in the present or future.
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure: If + Past Simple, Would + Base Verb</li>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue (implied):</em> "If a fresh tomato <strong>were a rare delicacy</strong>, my pasta primavera dreams <strong>would be shattered</strong>!" (The dialogue says "Imagine a world where a fresh tomato is a rare delicacy..." which describes an imagined situation. If we rephrase it as a Type 2 conditional, 'were' is more grammatically correct for hypothetical present situations).</li>
                    <li><em>Another example:</em> "If I had a lot of money, I would travel the world."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wipe out</strong>: To completely destroy or eliminate something.
                <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "Droughts are <strong>wiping out</strong> crops."</li></ul></li>
            <li><strong>Get your hands on (something)</strong>: To obtain something, often with some effort.
                <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "I'd be more concerned about how much actual food I can <strong>get my hands on</strong>."</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
