        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, Bob, thank goodness it's you! I'm having a bit of a crisis, Alice.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Crisis? Did your coffee machine stop working? That <em>is</em> serious.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Worse! I’m trying to book that cat yoga class for Saturday, but this website is just… <em>mrrrow</em>!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Cat yoga? You’re serious? I thought that was a joke! What’s the problem with the booking?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It keeps saying "invalid number of purrs"! No, wait, it says "invalid date format." How do I even <em>choose</em> the date?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Haha! "Invalid number of purrs" – I like that! Let me see. Is it asking for MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It just has a little calendar icon. I click it, but then nothing happens. My screen looks like a frozen kitten!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hmm, maybe it's a pop-up blocker. Or perhaps your browser is a little sleepy. Let me try on my phone.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, could you? I really want to go. The website said they only have two spots left!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, I’m on the website now. "Cat Yoga Studio," looking good... Ah, I see the date picker. Let’s try October 26th.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Yes, that’s the one! Did it work? Is it asking for my credit card now?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Almost there! It’s asking for your email for confirmation. And then, yes, payment details.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Perfect! You’re a lifesaver, Bob! My Saturday purr-fectly saved!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Any time, Alice! Just be ready for some serious stretching. And maybe some actual cat naps.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Don't worry, I've been practicing my downward-facing cat pose. Thanks again!</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>In today's world, using online booking is very common and convenient. You can book almost anything from your computer or phone! This means you don't have to call places or visit them in person. Many people use online booking for travel, like buying airplane tickets or reserving hotel rooms. You can also book tables at restaurants, tickets for concerts or movies, and even appointments with doctors or for unique activities like cat yoga! Websites and apps make it easy to choose dates, times, and pay, often letting you compare prices too.</p>

    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Present Continuous (for actions happening now)</strong>
                <p>We use the Present Continuous tense to talk about actions that are happening at the moment of speaking or around that time. It is formed with <strong>am/is/are + verb-ing</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I'm <strong>having</strong> a bit of a crisis." (The crisis is happening now)</li>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I'm <strong>trying</strong> to book that cat yoga class." (Alice is doing this action now)</li>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "It's <strong>asking</strong> for your email." (The website is doing this now)</li>
                    <li><em>More examples:</em> "I <strong>am cooking</strong> dinner now." "They <strong>are playing</strong> outside."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Basic Questions (Wh-questions and Yes/No questions)</strong>
                <p>We use questions to get information. There are two main types for beginners:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wh-questions:</strong> Use words like <strong>what, where, when, why, how</strong> to ask for specific information.<br>
                        <em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>What's</strong> the problem with the booking?" (Asking for information about the problem)</li>
                        <em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>How</strong> do I even choose the date?" (Asking for the method)
                        <br><em>More examples:</em> "Where are you going?" "When is your birthday?"
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Yes/No questions:</strong> These questions can be answered with "yes" or "no." They usually start with a helping verb (like <strong>is, are, do, does, can, could</strong>).<br>
                        <em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>Is</strong> it asking for MM/DD/YYYY?" (Can be answered yes or no)</li>
                        <em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>Did</strong> it work?" (Asking about a past action with a yes/no answer)
                        <br><em>More examples:</em> "Are you ready?" "Do you like coffee?"
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Making Requests and Offers</strong>
                <p>We use polite language to ask someone to do something (request) or to suggest doing something for them (offer).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requests (asking someone to do something):</strong> We often use <strong>Can you...?</strong> or <strong>Could you...?</strong><br>
                        <em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Oh, <strong>could you</strong>?" (Alice asks Bob for help)</li>
                        <br><em>More examples:</em> "Can you pass me the salt?" "Could you help me carry this?"
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Offers (suggesting to do something for someone):</strong> We often use <strong>Let me...</strong><br>
                        <em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>Let me see.</strong>" (Bob offers to look at the website)</li>
                        <em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>Let me try</strong> on my phone." (Bob offers to use his phone)
                        <br><em>More examples:</em> "Let me get you a drink." "Let me show you how to do it."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
