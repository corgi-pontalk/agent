        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, Bob, look at this giant fluffy alpaca plushie! It’s adorable!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, that thing is bigger than your head! You can’t be serious. How much is it?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: *Checks tag* It says $50! Fifty dollars for a stuffed animal? That’s a bit steep, don’t you think?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Steep? That’s highway robbery for something that just sits there looking cute! Time to bargain!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bargain? Me? I’m terrible at that! What do I even say?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Just try, "Is this your best price?" Start there.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: *Clears throat, approaches the vendor* Excuse me, is this your best price for this lovely alpaca?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: *Turns to Bob, whispers* He just nodded and said it's lucky!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, now offer something lower. Don't be shy! Try $30.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Thirty dollars? That’s a big jump! Okay… *To vendor* How about $30?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: *Whispers to Bob* He said $45! Still too much!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, counter! Try $35. And look sad!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: *To vendor, with a pout* Could you do $35? It's for my... very sad goldfish. He needs cheering up.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: *Gasps, whispers to Bob* He went down to $40! For the goldfish!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Nice work, Alice! Now, if you *really* want it, take it. Or you can try to walk away.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I really want it! Okay, $40 it is! *To vendor* Deal!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Wow, Alice, you’re a natural! Who knew your goldfish had such bargaining power?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: He’s a very emotional goldfish, Bob! And now he has a giant alpaca friend!</p>

    <div class="current-situation">
        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Bargaining (also known as haggling) is the act of negotiating the price of an item or service. It's common in many cultures around the world, especially in places like flea markets, street markets, small souvenir shops, or when buying large items like cars or houses. In these situations, the initial price offered by the seller might not be the final price, and they expect you to make a counter-offer.</p>
        <p>However, bargaining is generally *not* common in supermarkets, department stores, chain stores, or most restaurants in Western countries. In these places, prices are usually fixed. It's important to understand the local customs before attempting to bargain!</p>
        <p>When bargaining, always be polite and friendly. It's a fun interaction, not a fight!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-phrases">
        <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Is this your best price?</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: "Excuse me, is this your best price for this beautiful rug?"</li>
            <li><strong>How about [price]?</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: "This necklace is $20. How about $15?"</li>
            <li><strong>Could you do [price]?</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: "The seller wants $100 for the painting. Could you do $80?" (This is a polite way to suggest a lower price.)</li>
            <li><strong>Can I get a discount?</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: "I'm buying two items. Can I get a discount?"</li>
            <li><strong>It's a bit expensive/steep.</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: "I like the hat, but $40 is a bit steep for me."</li>
            <li><strong>That's my final offer.</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: "I can't go any lower. That's my final offer: $25."</li>
            <li><strong>Deal!</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: "You want $30? Okay, deal!" (This means you agree to the price.)</li>
            <li><strong>No, thank you.</strong><br>
                <em>Example</em>: (If you don't agree on a price) "No, thank you. I'll keep looking."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question Formation: "Is this your best price?"</strong>
                <p>This is a "yes/no" question. We use "Is" (a form of 'to be') at the beginning. "Best" is the superlative form of "good," meaning the most good. We use "your" to ask about *their* best price.</p>
                <p><em>Structure</em>: Is + [noun] + [adjective (superlative)] + [possessive pronoun]?</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Making Suggestions: "How about [price]?"</strong>
                <p>This is a common and friendly way to suggest something, especially a different price. It's followed by a noun (the price) or a gerund (verb + -ing).</p>
                <p><em>Structure</em>: How about + [price/noun]?</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Polite Requests: "Could you do [price]?"</strong>
                <p>"Could" is a modal verb that makes a request very polite. It's more polite than "Can you do [price]?" It implies asking if they are *able* to offer that price.</p>
                <p><em>Structure</em>: Could + [subject] + [verb] + [object]?</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Describing Degree: "a bit," "too much/expensive"</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A bit:</strong> Used to slightly reduce the intensity of an adjective.
                        <em>Example</em>: "It's <em>a bit</em> expensive." (Meaning: somewhat expensive, but not extremely).</li>
                    <li><strong>Too much/expensive:</strong> Used to say something is more than desirable or acceptable.
                        <em>Example</em>: "$50 is <em>too much</em> for this small item." (Meaning: it exceeds what is reasonable).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
