    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, fancy seeing you here! Are you... clutching a yoga mat?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! Shhh, it's a secret weapon against my desk-job-induced stiffness. Don't tell anyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A secret weapon, huh? Last time I checked, your secret weapon was a triple espresso.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, times change! I'm trying to embrace the global wellness trend. My back demanded it.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: So you've joined the legions of people doing downward dog? I thought you were more of a 'sit on the couch and watch sports' kind of guy.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hey, I can be both! But seriously, it's pretty relaxing. And the stretches... oh, the stretches! I feel like a pretzel that's finally uncoiling.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Laughing) A pretzel uncoiling! That's a vivid image. I guess it makes sense, yoga's popularity has really exploded worldwide.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Absolutely! Every second influencer seems to be doing a sunrise warrior pose on a mountain top. It's inspiring... and slightly intimidating.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: True! I even saw my grandma trying to do a tree pose last week. She said she was trying to find her "inner zen."</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: See? It's gone mainstream! From celebrity gurus to local community centers, everyone's seeking a bit of mindfulness.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I tried a hot yoga class once. I felt less zen and more like a melting candle. My "inner zen" was screaming for air conditioning.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (Chuckles) Hot yoga isn't for everyone. But there are so many types now – Vinyasa, Hatha, Restorative... something for every pretzel, I mean, person.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You're really into it, aren't you? Next thing I know, you'll be on a silent meditation retreat in Bali.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Don't tempt me! A digital detox and some serious stretching sound pretty good right now. My shoulders are practically glued to my ears.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, good for you, Bob! Maybe I should give it another go. My shoulders could use some un-gluing too. Namaste!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>

The fast-paced modern world has led many to seek solace and balance, making yoga and other wellness activities highly appealing. From high-end retreats to local community classes, and from celebrity endorsements to everyday practitioners, the wellness industry continues to expand, offering diverse practices to help individuals find their "inner zen" and combat the stresses of daily life.</p>
