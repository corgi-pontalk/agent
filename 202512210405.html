    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, what are you doing? You look very focused, or maybe just confused.</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! Perfect timing. I'm trying to write my CV, but I feel like I need to make 'washing dishes' sound like an Olympic sport.</p>
        <p>Alice: (Laughing) Oh, Bob. It's not *that* dramatic. You need to focus on key <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>experience</strong>.</p>
        <p>Bob: Right! So, for skills, I put "Expert in competitive napping" and "Highly proficient in snack consumption."</p>
        <p>Alice: (Shakes head playfully) Uh, those are... unique. But for a job, think about things like being <strong>organized</strong>, <strong>detail-oriented</strong>, or even "good communication."</p>
        <p>Bob: Organized! Like how I organize my socks by color? Or detail-oriented, like noticing the exact crumb count on the kitchen floor?</p>
        <p>Alice: Closer! More like "managed inventory" if you worked in a shop, or "prepared reports" if you helped somewhere. For your part-time library job, you could say you were <strong>responsible</strong> for shelving books.</p>
        <p>Bob: Ah, "responsible"! I am responsible for making sure the TV remote never gets lost. That's a huge <strong>accomplishment</strong>, right?</p>
        <p>Alice: (Chuckles) While important at home, for a CV, accomplishments are things like "improved customer satisfaction by 10%" or "successfully completed X project."</p>
        <p>Bob: So, "Successfully completed a 10-hour Netflix marathon" is out?</p>
        <p>Alice: Definitely out! How about focusing on something like "demonstrated <strong>initiative</strong> by helping patrons find books" at the library?</p>
        <p>Bob: Initiative! That sounds fancy. So, instead of "I waited for instructions," I can say "I took <strong>proactive</strong> steps"?</p>
        <p>Alice: Exactly! Taking proactive steps means you don't wait to be told; you just do it. It shows you're a good <strong>team player</strong> too, if you help others without being asked.</p>
        <p>Bob: Got it! So, I need to sound like a superhero, but for boring stuff. Organized, detail-oriented, responsible, initiative, proactive...</p>
        <p>Alice: And don't forget <strong>reliable</strong>. Someone who always shows up on time and finishes tasks.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, I'm super reliable! I'm reliably late... Just kidding! Thanks, Alice. This actually helps a lot. Now, how do I make "made coffee for the boss" sound like "managed beverage logistics"?</p>
        <p>Alice: (Smiling) Let's just stick to "prepared beverages for staff." Keep it professional but clear!</p>
        <p>Bob: Deal! You're the best CV coach ever.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>
        The job market today is very competitive, and a well-written CV (Curriculum Vitae) or Resume is your first chance to make a good impression. A CV is a formal document that summarizes your education, work experience, skills, and accomplishments. For beginners, it can be challenging to know what to include and how to describe their experiences in a professional and impactful way. Using specific, strong vocabulary can help your CV stand out to employers, showing them you are serious and capable, even when describing simple tasks you've done. Mastering these words is a key step towards landing your first job!

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-points">
        <p>When writing a CV, certain grammar structures and vocabulary choices are very effective:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Using Adjectives to Describe Yourself:</strong>
                <p>Words like "organized," "detail-oriented," "proactive," "reliable," and "responsible" are adjectives. You use them to describe your qualities.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Structure:</em> I am + <strong>adjective</strong>. / He/She is + <strong>adjective</strong>.</li>
                    <li><em>Examples:</em> I am <strong>organized</strong>. She is <strong>detail-oriented</strong>. They are <strong>reliable</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>"Be Responsible For" + Noun/Gerund (-ing verb):</strong>
                <p>This phrase is very common on CVs to state your duties or tasks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Structure:</em> I was <strong>responsible for</strong> + <strong>noun</strong>. / I was <strong>responsible for</strong> + <strong>verb-ing</strong>.</li>
                    <li><em>Examples:</em> I was <strong>responsible for customer service</strong>. (noun)<br>I was <strong>responsible for answering phone calls</strong>. (verb-ing)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Using Strong Action Verbs for Experience/Accomplishments:</strong>
                <p>CVs often use past tense action verbs to describe what you <em>did</em>. These verbs make your contributions sound more impactful than simple verbs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Examples:</em><br>
                        Instead of: "I made coffee." -> Use: "<strong>Prepared</strong> beverages."<br>
                        Instead of: "I helped customers." -> Use: "<strong>Assisted</strong> customers with inquiries."<br>
                        Instead of: "I looked after the store." -> Use: "<strong>Managed</strong> daily operations."<br>
                        Instead of: "I found solutions." -> Use: "<strong>Developed</strong> solutions."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
