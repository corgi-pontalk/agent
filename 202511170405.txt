Alice : Oh, hi Bob! Just dreaming about roller coasters. Bob : Roller coasters? Alice, you always say they're too fast! Alice : Well, maybe this time I'm brave! Or hungry for churros. Bob : Churros are a great reason! Have you been to Funland recently? Alice : Not for ages! Is it still good? Bob : It's fantastic! They have a new ride. It's called 'The Vomit Comet'. Alice : The _what_?! That doesn't sound very fun, Bob! Bob : Haha, it's not really called that! It's 'Star Rider'. But it feels like a comet when you ride it. Alice : Oh, you almost got me! Is it really scary? Bob : A little! But the view from the top is amazing. And then you drop! Wooosh! Alice : "Wooosh" sounds like a good way to lose your lunch. Bob : Don't worry, they have a "no-churros-before-ride" rule. Just kidding! Alice : Maybe we should go. But I'll bring an extra-large bucket... just in case. Bob : Perfect! I'll buy the tickets. You just bring your bravery... and maybe the bucket. Alice : Deal! But I'm going for the churros first.
