        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, you won't BELIEVE what the James Webb Telescope just found!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice, let me guess. They finally found my missing socks in a distant galaxy?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Even better! They've identified a super-early galaxy that looks like it's made of pure glitter and stardust, and it's much more massive than we thought possible for its age.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Glitter and stardust? So, basically a cosmic rave party. I'm in! But wait, 'super-early'? How early are we talking?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Like, practically right after the Big Bang! It's challenging everything we thought we knew about galaxy formation. It truly blows my mind.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Blows your mind? Mine's currently trying to get its head around why my toast always burns on one side. This is on a whole other level.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! And thereâ€™s more! They also confirmed water vapor in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, GJ 486 b, which is a super-Earth. It's too hot for liquid water, but still, water!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Water vapor on a super-Earth. So, a super-sauna, then? I hope they packed tiny towels.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You're hilarious. But seriously, this could be a big step towards finding habitable planets. Imagine finding actual alien life!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> If they find aliens, I hope they're not too judgmental about my burned toast. Or maybe they have a universal toaster setting.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You're incorrigible! But isn't it incredible how much information we're getting from something billions of light-years away?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It's mind-boggling, I'll give you that. It makes my usual Monday morning commute seem utterly insignificant. In a good way, I guess.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Definitely in a good way! It reminds us how much there is still to discover.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Speaking of discoveries, I just discovered I'm out of coffee. A more immediate, albeit less cosmic, crisis.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha! Well, some mysteries are just too big for even the James Webb Telescope to solve, like why we always run out of coffee at the worst possible moment.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an infrared space observatory launched in December 2021. It is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is significantly more powerful, designed to observe the most distant objects in the universe, such as the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang, and to study the atmospheres of exoplanets in detail.</p>
        <p>Since its full operation began in mid-2022, JWST has delivered groundbreaking discoveries. It has detected galaxies that are much older, larger, and brighter than theories predicted for the early universe, challenging existing cosmological models. For example, it has identified galaxies existing just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, showing mature stellar populations. Additionally, JWST has provided unprecedented data on exoplanet atmospheres, confirming the presence of molecules like water vapor and methane on several distant worlds, bringing us closer to understanding planetary formation and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Present Perfect Tense for Recent Discoveries and Unfinished Past Actions</h3>
        <p>The dialogue frequently uses the Present Perfect tense (<em>have/has + past participle</em>) to talk about discoveries that happened recently and have a connection to the present, or actions that started in the past and continue to affect the present.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alice:</strong> "They've identified a super-early galaxy..." (A recent discovery, the results of which are still relevant.)</li>
            <li><strong>Alice:</strong> "They also confirmed water vapor..." (Another recent finding.)</li>
            <li><strong>Current Situation:</strong> "JWST has delivered groundbreaking discoveries." (An ongoing period of discoveries since its operation began.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + has/have + Past Participle</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Scientists <strong>have found</strong> evidence of ice on Mars. (The finding happened, and its impact is current.)</p>

        <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Possibility and Speculation</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs like "could," "might," and "would" are used to express possibility, speculation, or hypothetical situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alice:</strong> "this <strong>could</strong> be a big step towards finding habitable planets." (Expressing possibility)</li>
            <li><strong>Bob:</strong> "Or maybe they <strong>have</strong> a universal toaster setting." (Implies "they might have," expressing speculation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> We <strong>might</strong> discover even more astonishing things in the future. (Possibility)</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If it <strong>were</strong> habitable, it <strong>would</strong> be amazing. (Hypothetical situation with 'would')</p>

        <h3>3. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs combine a verb with a preposition or adverb, changing the verb's meaning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Get your head around:</strong> To understand something difficult. (e.g., "trying to get its head around why my toast always burns")</li>
            <li><strong>Run out of:</strong> To use up a supply of something completely. (e.g., "I just discovered I'm out of coffee.")</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Scientists are trying to <strong>figure out</strong> how this galaxy formed. (Figure out = understand)</p>
