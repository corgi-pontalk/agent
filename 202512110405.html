    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hi, Bob! What are you listening to? You look like you're having a dance party in your head.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, Alice! It's just my favorite band, "The Screaming Chickens." They're so good!</p>
        <p>Alice: "The Screaming Chickens"? That sounds... unique. What kind of music do they play?</p>
        <p>Bob: It's super loud rock, with a bit of heavy metal! The guitars are amazing!</p>
        <p>Alice: Wow, loud rock, huh? I usually like something a bit... softer. Like pop music.</p>
        <p>Bob: Pop? Oh, no! Too many catchy songs! They get stuck in my head for days!</p>
        <p>Alice: But that's the point! They make you happy! Like "Sunshine Day" by Sparkle Pop.</p>
        <p>Bob: "Sparkle Pop"? Is that even a real band? Sounds like a soda commercial.</p>
        <p>Alice: Hey! They're very popular! My sister loves them too. What about something else? Do you like classical music?</p>
        <p>Bob: Classical? Like violins and quiet rooms? Sometimes. If I need to sleep.</p>
        <p>Alice: Haha! Okay, maybe not. What about jazz? Smooth and cool?</p>
        <p>Bob: Hmm, jazz is okay. But it doesn't make me want to air guitar.</p>
        <p>Alice: I see! So, "The Screaming Chickens" and air guitar are your main hobbies.</p>
        <p>Bob: Exactly! What about you? Besides "Sparkle Pop," do you have a favorite artist?</p>
        <p>Alice: Well, I really enjoy soulful singers. Like Adele. Her voice is incredible.</p>
        <p>Bob: Adele! Okay, I know Adele. She can really sing! Not screaming chickens, but good!</p>
        <p>Alice: See? We *can* agree on some music, Bob!</p>
        <p>Bob: Maybe we just need to find a band called "The Soulful Screaming Chickens"?</p>
        <p>Alice: (Laughs) Now *that* I'd listen to!</p>
