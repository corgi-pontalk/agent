Alice : Hey Bob, you look like you're planning world domination. What's up? Bob : Alice! Not world domination, but maybe... business domination! I want to start my own company. Alice : Wow! A company? You, a CEO? What kind of business? A dog walking empire? Bob : Even better! I'm thinking... a gourmet banana stand. With tiny hats for the bananas. Alice : (Laughs) Tiny hats? That's certainly... unique. But entrepreneurship? That's a big step. Bob : Exactly! I'm tired of working for others. I want to be my own boss. Make my own rules! Alice : And make your own money, right? That's the dream. But it's a lot of hard work. Long hours. Bob : I know, I know. But imagine the freedom! No more boring meetings. Just me and my bananas. Alice : What about a business plan? Do you need capital? Investors? Bob : Uh... a plan? I have a vision! And for capital, I have my piggy bank. Its name is Kevin. Alice : Kevin the piggy bank might not be enough for a banana empire, Bob. Bob : Details, details! The important thing is the idea. And the tiny hats. Alice : You're really serious about this, aren't you? Bob : Absolutely! Wish me luck. Maybe you can be my head of banana hat design? Alice : (Smiles) I'll consider it. Good luck, Bob! And don't forget the tiny umbrella for rainy days.
