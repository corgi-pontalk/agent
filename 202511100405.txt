Alice : Bob, you won't believe my trip! Bob : Oh, Alice! Tell me everything. Good, I hope? Alice : Good? Ha! My flight was delayed... for five hours! Bob : Five hours? That's awful! What did you do? Alice : I read a whole book, ate three airport cookies, and almost learned to juggle with two oranges I bought. Bob : Almost learned to juggle? That sounds like a very long delay! Alice : It was! But wait, there's more. When I finally landed, guess what? Bob : Your luggage... it didn't arrive? Alice : Bingo! My bright pink suitcase, gone! Poof! Bob : Oh no! Not the pink one! Did they find it? Alice : Eventually, yes. Three days later. It went on its own adventure to Hawaii, apparently. Bob : Hawaii? Lucky suitcase! Did you get a tan without it? Alice : Very funny! I had to buy new clothes. My vacation started with an unplanned shopping spree. Bob : Well, at least you got some new outfits! So, next trip by train? Alice : Maybe a hot air balloon! Less chance of lost luggage, right?
