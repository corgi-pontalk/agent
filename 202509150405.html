        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, why do you look so <em>grumpy</em> today? Are you <em>angry</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Angry? No, Alice! I'm just <em>hungry</em>! My stomach is <em>sad</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hungry? Oh, I thought you were <em>upset</em> about something. You look so serious!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Understanding and expressing our <strong>feelings and emotions</strong> is a very important part of daily communication. When we talk about how we feel, we help others understand us better and build stronger relationships. For beginners, learning basic emotion words like 'happy,' 'sad,' 'angry,' and 'excited' is a great start. People show their feelings in many ways â€“ through their words, their voice, and even their face. In English, we often use specific verbs like "feel," "am," or "look" to describe how we or others are feeling.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>I am [feeling].</strong>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> I am <em>happy</em> today.</p></li>
        <li><strong>You look [feeling].</strong>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> You look <em>tired</em>.</p></li>
        <li><strong>How are you feeling?</strong>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> "How are you feeling?" "I'm feeling good, thank you!"</p></li>
        <li><strong>That makes me feel [feeling].</strong>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> Getting a gift makes me feel <em>excited</em>.</p></li>
        <li><strong>I feel [feeling] when...</strong>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> I feel <em>stressed</em> when I have a lot of work.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Don't be [feeling]!</strong>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> Don't be <em>sad</em>! Everything will be okay.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Common Feelings & Emotions:</strong> happy, sad, angry, tired, excited, hungry, surprised, confused, stressed, frustrated, annoyed, relieved, jealous, bored, ecstatic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <p>When talking about feelings, we mostly use adjectives. Here's how to use them with common verbs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The verb "to be" + Adjective (e.g., I am happy)</strong>
            <p>We use forms of the verb "to be" (am, is, are) with an adjective to describe a feeling.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I <strong>am</strong> <em>happy</em>.</li>
                <li>You <strong>are</strong> <em>sad</em>.</li>
                <li>He/She/It <strong>is</strong> <em>excited</em>.</li>
                <li>We <strong>are</strong> <em>tired</em>.</li>
                <li>They <strong>are</strong> <em>confused</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The verb "feel" + Adjective (e.g., I feel happy)</strong>
            <p>The verb "feel" is another common way to express emotions. It is often interchangeable with "to be" when talking about current emotional states.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I <strong>feel</strong> <em>happy</em>.</li>
                <li>You <strong>feel</strong> <em>sad</em>.</li>
                <li>He/She <strong>feels</strong> <em>excited</em>. (Remember the 's' for he/she/it in simple present!)</li>
                <li>We <strong>feel</strong> <em>tired</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The verb "look" + Adjective (e.g., You look tired)</strong>
            <p>We use "look" to describe how someone appears, which often tells us about their feeling or state.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You <strong>look</strong> <em>tired</em>.</li>
                <li>She <strong>looks</strong> <em>happy</em>.</li>
                <li>They <strong>look</strong> <em>surprised</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>"Don't be..." (Imperative for advice)</strong>
            <p>We use "Don't be" + an adjective to tell someone not to feel a certain way. It's a way to offer comfort or advice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't be</strong> <em>sad</em>!</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be</strong> <em>angry</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
