    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Bob, have you seen this new phone? It's incredible! The camera is like having a professional studio in your pocket.</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! You're always eyeing the latest tech. I just saw an article about how some of these gadgets might actually be made.</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh no, don't tell me it's another one of those 'ethically sourced' nightmares. My 'guilt-free' organic avocado toast habit is already financially crippling. I can't add smartphone guilt to the menu.</p>
        <p>Bob: Well, this article was about child labor concerns in supply chains. Apparently, it's a bigger issue than most of us realize, even for things we use every single day.</p>
        <p>Alice: Child labor? Seriously? I thought we were past that in this century. I picture Victorian chimney sweeps, not sleek, touchscreen devices.</p>
        <p>Bob: Exactly! But it's often hidden deep in the supply chain. Think of the raw materials – cobalt for batteries, cocoa for chocolate, cotton for clothes. It’s hard to trace every step.</p>
        <p>Alice: So, my fancy new eco-friendly water bottle might have a dark secret? I'm going to start knitting my own clothes and growing my own wheat. This is getting ridiculous!</p>
        <p>Bob: Not a bad idea, actually! But short of becoming a self-sufficient hermit, what can we do? Companies are supposed to exercise due diligence.</p>
        <p>Alice: Due diligence? Sounds like something my landlord says when he's about to raise the rent. Do companies actually check thoroughly, or do they just tick a box on a form?</p>
        <p>Bob: That's the million-dollar question. Consumers demanding transparency helps, but it's incredibly complex. Tracing every single component from mine to market is a logistical nightmare.</p>
        <p>Alice: So, the artisanal chocolate bar I'm craving might have been picked by tiny hands? My sweet tooth suddenly tastes like existential dread.</p>
        <p>Bob: Pretty much. It's not always direct child labor, but if a company isn't carefully vetting its suppliers, there's a significant risk.</p>
        <p>Alice: Ugh, now I feel guilty about everything. My sneakers, my coffee, even that ridiculous light-up dog collar I bought for Fido. Is Fido's collar tainted?</p>
        <p>Bob: Possibly, Alice, possibly. Maybe Fido can join you in your knitting revolution. But seriously, it’s about awareness and pushing companies to clean up their acts.</p>
        <p>Alice: Right. No more impulse buys without a quick 'ethical check' from now on. My wallet might actually thank me... eventually.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Child labor remains a significant global concern, particularly within complex supply chains for various industries. Despite international conventions and national laws, millions of children, some as young as five, are engaged in hazardous work, denying them education, health, and fundamental freedoms.</p>
    <p>This issue is prevalent in sectors such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mining</strong>: For raw materials like cobalt (used in electronics batteries), mica (used in cosmetics and automotive paint), and gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Agriculture</strong>: Including cocoa (chocolate), coffee, cotton, and tobacco, where children often work long hours in dangerous conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Textile and Garment Industry</strong>: Children may be involved in ginning cotton, spinning yarn, or sewing garments.</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing and Electronics</strong>: Though often deeper in the supply chain, children can be involved in the initial processing of components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The complexity of global supply chains, often involving multiple tiers of suppliers, sub-contractors, and informal labor, makes it difficult for companies to have full visibility and control over their entire production process. Lack of transparency, inadequate enforcement of labor laws, and poverty in source countries contribute to the persistence of child labor.</p>
    <p>However, there is growing pressure from consumers, NGOs, and governments for companies to implement robust due diligence processes, ensuring their products are free from child labor. Many businesses are now investing in traceability technologies, conducting independent audits, and collaborating with local communities to address the root causes of child labor. New legislation in various countries also aims to hold companies accountable for human rights abuses in their supply chains.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h3>1. The Passive Voice</h3>
        <p>The passive voice is used when the focus is on the action itself, rather than on who or what is performing the action. It's especially useful when the doer of the action is unknown, unimportant, or obvious from the context.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure</strong>: <code>Subject + form of "to be" + Past Participle (of main verb)</code></li>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>"how some of these gadgets <strong>might actually be made</strong>." (Focus on the making, not who makes them.)</li>
                    <li>"I thought we <strong>were past that</strong> in this century." (Focus on the state of being past something.)</li>
                    <li>"The artisanal chocolate bar I'm craving <strong>might have been picked</strong> by tiny hands?" (Focus on the picking, not explicitly naming the pickers.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why it's useful for this topic</strong>: When discussing child labor in supply chains, often the actual individuals performing the exploitation (the 'doer') are hidden or represent large, complex systems, so the passive voice allows us to focus on the <em>fact</em> of labor being performed or materials being sourced.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Speculation and Possibility</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs like <code>might</code>, <code>may</code>, and <code>could</code> are used to express varying degrees of possibility, probability, or speculation about present or past events.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><code>might</code> / <code>may</code></strong>: Suggests a possibility, but less certain than <code>will</code>. <code>May</code> is slightly more formal than <code>might</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example</em>: "some of these gadgets <strong>might actually be made</strong>." (Bob is speculating about how they <em>could</em> be made.)</li>
                    <li><em>Example</em>: "my fancy new eco-friendly water bottle <strong>might have a dark secret</strong>?" (Alice is speculating about a possible negative aspect.)</li>
                    <li><em>Example</em>: "The artisanal chocolate bar I'm craving <strong>might have been picked</strong> by tiny hands?" (Alice is speculating about the origin.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong><code>could</code></strong>: Also suggests possibility, ability, or permission, and can be used to describe something that is theoretically possible but perhaps less likely in the speaker's mind.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example (not in dialogue but relevant)</em>: "Child labor <strong>could be present</strong> in many hidden parts of the industry."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Structure for past speculation</strong>: <code>Modal verb + have + Past Participle</code>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example</em>: "The chocolate bar <strong>might have been picked</strong>..." (Speculating about a past event.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
