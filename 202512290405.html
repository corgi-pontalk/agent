        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice, can you help me with something? It's really important!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob! Oh, okay. What do you need? Is it heavy? Because my "heavy lifting" fee is quite high today.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Haha, very funny. It's just moving some boxes in my apartment. But one of them is HUGE. Like, really, really huge.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Hmm, "really, really huge," you say? What's in it for me? Free lunch?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Lunch? Uh, I was thinking... a heartfelt thank you?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: A heartfelt thank you won't feed me, Bob. My stomach negotiates hard.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Okay, okay! How about coffee and a donut? My treat, after the boxes are moved.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Coffee and a donut... for the HUGE box? That's a strong "no way!" from my muscles.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Ugh, fine! How about coffee, a donut, AND I'll wash your car next weekend?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Ooh, washing my car? Now you're talking! Does "next weekend" mean "definitely by Sunday evening"?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Yes, definitely by Sunday evening! Deal?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Let me think... okay, that sounds fair. But I choose the donut flavor!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Deal! You can choose any donut flavor. Even the sprinkles one.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Excellent! See, Bob? Everyone's a negotiator when they try hard enough.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: You're tough, Alice. Really tough. Remind me never to buy a car from you!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Negotiations aren't just for business people in fancy suits! We negotiate every day without even realizing it. When you decide who pays for coffee with a friend, or if you can borrow your sibling's favorite shirt, or even what movie to watch, you are negotiating! It's about talking to find an agreement that works for everyone. For beginners, understanding simple phrases to ask for things, make offers, and agree or disagree is a great start to everyday English conversations.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Asking Questions with "What"</h3>
        <p>We use "What" to ask for information about things. It helps us understand details.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What</b> do you need? (Asking for the specific item or favor)</li>
            <li><b>What's</b> (What is) in it for me? (Asking about the benefit)</li>
            <li><b>What's</b> the news? (Asking for information)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Using "Can" for Requests and Ability</h3>
        <p>"Can" is a helpful word for asking if someone is able to do something or for making a polite request.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Can</b> you help me? (Requesting help)</li>
            <li>I <b>can</b> offer you coffee. (Stating what you are able to give)</li>
            <li>I <b>can't</b> (cannot) lift that box. (Stating what you are not able to do)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Simple Present Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the simple present tense for actions that happen regularly, facts, or things that are generally true.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My stomach <b>negotiates</b> hard. (A general truth about her stomach)</li>
            <li>I <b>need</b> your help. (A current fact/request)</li>
            <li>She <b>chooses</b> the donut flavor. (A habit or agreement)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
