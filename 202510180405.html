    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, guess what? Big news!</p>
        <p>Bob: What, Alice? Did you finally learn to juggle? Or win the lottery?</p>
        <p>Alice: (Laughs) No, silly! Remember Sarah? Our friend from college? She's getting married!</p>
        <p>Bob: Wow! Really? That's huge! Who's the lucky guy?</p>
        <p>Alice: Mark! They've been together forever. I'm so excited for them!</p>
        <p>Bob: Mark, huh? Good for them! I wonder if there will be a lot of dancing. My moves are legendary.</p>
        <p>Alice: Of course there will be dancing! And a giant wedding cake! That's my absolute favorite part.</p>
        <p>Bob: Cake is good. Very good. But the suits... do I have to wear a suit? They're so uncomfortable, like a fancy prison.</p>
        <p>Alice: Bob, it's a wedding! You have to look nice. Maybe you'll even catch the bouquet!</p>
        <p>Bob: The bouquet? Isn't that for the ladies? I'd much rather catch an extra slice of cake or a falling canapé.</p>
        <p>Alice: (Giggles) You're impossible! I'm already thinking about my dress.</p>
        <p>Bob: Just don't wear a white one. That's for the bride! You don't want to confuse people.</p>
        <p>Alice: I know that, Mr. Expert! Maybe a nice blue one, or a sparkly green.</p>
        <p>Bob: Sounds good. As long as it's not a giant fluffy one that takes up two seats. I need my space for dancing.</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh, you! It's going to be a beautiful wedding! And yes, there will be cake for you.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Weddings are special events where two people celebrate their love and officially become a married couple. Traditionally, there is a ceremony, often in a church or a special venue, where the couple "exchange vows" (make promises to each other). The bride usually wears a beautiful white "wedding dress," and the groom wears a suit. After the ceremony, there's often a "wedding reception" – a party with food, music, dancing, and a big "wedding cake." Today, weddings can be very different. Some are big and traditional, while others are small, modern, or even have a unique theme. People choose many locations like beaches, gardens, or city halls. The most important part is the couple's commitment and celebration together.</p>
