    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, what's got you glued to your phone? You look like you've just seen a ghost, or a very fancy plankton.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! You won't believe this. Scientists just discovered a new species of deep-sea anglerfish, and it's... well, let's just say it makes the old ones look cuddly. It has fangs for days and a glowing lure that looks like a miniature horror movie scene.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, another one? They're always finding bizarre creatures down there. Is it from one of those new hydrothermal vent fields?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Exactly! And apparently, the vent field itself is absolutely teeming with creatures nobody's ever seen before. It's like an alien city at the bottom of the ocean, only with more giant, eyeless shrimp.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> That's incredible! Think of the biodiversity. These discoveries are crucial for understanding how life can adapt to such extreme environments.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Or crucial for confirming my worst fears about what lurks beneath. Imagine swimming along, minding your own business, and suddenly *BAM* â€“ a fang-toothed monster with its own built-in nightlight!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Luckily, it's about 4,000 meters down. I don't think it's going to join you for a paddle in the shallow end anytime soon.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> You say that *now*. What if they evolve to handle shallower waters? Or worse, what if they figure out how to use the internet and start tweeting menacing selfies?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> You're being dramatic, Bob. These discoveries push the boundaries of our knowledge, helping us understand climate change and even potential new medicines.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Yeah, yeah, science is good. But can science also invent a force field for when the glowing fanged fish decide to migrate north?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Highly unlikely. But isn't it mind-boggling how much of our own planet remains unexplored, especially the oceans?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> It really is. Like finding a whole new world right here on Earth. Just a world I wouldn't want to visit without a very heavily armored submarine.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Agreed. It makes you wonder what other secrets the deep holds.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> I just hope those secrets stay, well, secret. Or at least don't glow too brightly near my boat.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Now *that* would be a plot twist for your next fishing trip!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Ocean exploration continues to be one of the most exciting frontiers in science. Despite covering over 70% of Earth's surface, more than 80% of our oceans remain unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored. Recent advancements in technology, such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and advanced submersibles, are allowing scientists to venture deeper and stay longer in extreme environments like the abyssal plains and hydrothermal vents.</p>
    <p>These explorations are yielding astonishing discoveries almost daily. Scientists are constantly identifying new species of marine life, many of which exhibit extraordinary adaptations to life without sunlight, under immense pressure, and at extreme temperatures. Beyond bizarre creatures, new ecosystems are being found, including vast coral reefs in deep, cold waters and chemosynthetic communities thriving around volcanic vents. These findings are crucial not only for expanding our understanding of biodiversity and evolution but also for insights into Earth's climate systems, geological processes, and even the potential for new resources, including pharmaceuticals and sustainable energy solutions. The deep ocean is a vast repository of unknown life and processes, playing a vital role in the global ecosystem that we are only just beginning to comprehend.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Phrasal Verb: "Glued to"</h3>
    <p>The phrasal verb "glued to" means to be very focused on, staring intently at, or unable to move away from something, often a screen. It implies a strong, almost physical attachment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> be + glued to + noun (usually a screen, book, or person)</li>
        <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "What's got you <em>glued to your phone</em>?"</li>
        <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "The kids were <em>glued to the TV</em>, watching cartoons all morning."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Adjectives for Description (e.g., "teeming," "crucial," "mind-boggling")</h3>
    <p>Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns. In the dialogue, several strong adjectives are used to convey vivid imagery and strong opinions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Teeming:</strong> describes something that is full of or swarming with living things.
            <br><span class="example-sentence">Example: The pond was <em>teeming</em> with tadpoles.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Crucial:</strong> means extremely important or essential.
            <br><span class="example-sentence">Example: Timely information is <em>crucial</em> for making good decisions.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Mind-boggling:</strong> means extremely surprising, astonishing, or difficult to imagine.
            <br><span class="example-sentence">Example: The amount of detail in the ancient artwork was <em>mind-boggling</em>.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 - Real Conditional) with "What if...?"</h3>
    <p>Type 1 conditional sentences talk about real and possible situations in the future. We often use "What if...?" to ask about a possible future scenario and its potential consequences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> What if + Subject + Simple Present verb (cause), [then] Subject + Will/Can/May + Base verb (result)? (Often the result is implied or left open for discussion.)</li>
        <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "<em>What if they evolve</em> to handle shallower waters?" (Implied result: "then that would be bad!")</li>
        <li><strong>Another example:</strong> "<em>What if it rains</em> tomorrow? We'll have to cancel the picnic."</li>
    </ul>
