    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, have you seen the headlines lately? It’s like the whole world is melting!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, I know right? I just saw a report about Europe and Asia – they’re basically giant saunas!
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: "Giant saunas" is an understatement! My friend in Spain sent me a photo of her car dashboard, and it looked like a science experiment gone wrong. Seriously, melted plastic.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ha! I believe it. I was planning a trip to Italy later this year, but now I’m wondering if I should just pack a personal ice maker and a portable air conditioner.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good luck with that! My cousin in Tokyo said it's so hot, people are starting to cook eggs on the sidewalks. She literally tried it.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: No way! That's not just a myth? I thought that was an urban legend for *really* extreme heat. This is wild.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Apparently not! She said her air conditioning is running 24/7, and her electric bill is going to be astronomical. She's practically living in a refrigerator.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Mine too, and I'm just here in our relatively cooler city. Imagine being *in* a heatwave like that. I heard temperatures hit 45°C in some places.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: More like 50°C in others! It’s truly unprecedented. I saw a meme that said "Earth is just trying to preheat itself for the aliens."
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (chuckles) That’s dark, but funny! Seriously though, it makes you wonder about the long-term impact, doesn't it?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Absolutely. I mean, it’s one thing to complain about a sweaty commute, but this is on a whole other level. People's health is at risk.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly. I saw advice telling people to stay indoors, hydrate constantly, and avoid strenuous activity. Sounds like a really fun summer holiday for anyone there.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Right? Forget sightseeing, it's all about strategic shade-seeking and rationing your ice cream supplies. Maybe a swim in a giant public fountain?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, at least we can commiserate from the comfort of our relatively cooler (for now!) homes.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: For now! But I think I'll still invest in a personal misting fan. Just in case our turn comes next.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Good call! Better safe than spontaneously combusting. Or, you know, just very, very sweaty.
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Heatwaves are periods of abnormally hot weather lasting several days. Recently, both Europe and Asia have been grappling with unprecedented and prolonged heatwaves. Record-breaking temperatures, often exceeding 40°C (104°F) and even reaching close to 50°C (122°F) in some regions, have been widely reported. Countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, China, and Japan have experienced severe impacts.</p>
    <p>These extreme heat events lead to significant health risks, including heatstroke and dehydration, particularly among vulnerable populations. They also put immense strain on infrastructure, causing power outages as air conditioning systems work overtime. Agriculture suffers from drought and crop damage, while the risk of wildfires dramatically increases. Scientists link the increasing frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to climate change, highlighting the urgent need for adaptation and mitigation strategies globally.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hit the headlines</strong>: To be an important news story, widely reported.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Example: The heatwave has been hitting the headlines all week.</em></div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Giant sauna</strong>: A humorous or exaggerated way to describe a very hot and humid place.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Understatement</strong>: A statement that describes something as smaller or less important than it actually is, often used for ironic or humorous effect.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Example: Calling the 50°C weather "warm" would be a huge understatement.</em></div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Science experiment gone wrong</strong>: A humorous way to describe something that has become messy, melted, or otherwise deformed due to unusual or extreme conditions.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Example: After sitting in the sun, my chocolate bar looked like a science experiment gone wrong.</em></div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Running 24/7</strong>: Operating continuously, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Astronomical (bill/cost)</strong>: Extremely large or high.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Example: With the AC on all the time, my electricity bill is going to be astronomical.</em></div>
        </li>
        <li><strong>On a whole other level</strong>: Much more extreme, significant, or impressive than something else.
            <div class="example-sentence"><em>Example: This summer's heat is on a whole other level compared to previous years.</em></div>

    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "have been grappling," "has been running")</h3>
    <p>This tense is used to talk about an action that started in the past and is still continuing in the present, or has recently stopped but has an ongoing effect. It emphasizes the duration or continuous nature of an action up to the present moment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong>: <code>Subject + has/have + been + verb-ing</code></li>
        <li><strong>Examples from the dialogue/current situation</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>"Europe and Asia <strong>have been grappling</strong> with unprecedented and prolonged heatwaves." (The grappling started in the past and continues now.)</li>
                <li>"Her air conditioning <strong>is running 24/7</strong>" (present continuous, but for extended periods or continuous action with ongoing effect) or more specifically, "My air conditioner <strong>has been running</strong> non-stop for days."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Usage</strong>: It's perfect for describing situations like heatwaves that have been ongoing for some time and whose effects are still felt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Figurative Language & Hyperbole</h3>
    <p>Friends often use figurative language and hyperbole to make their conversations more engaging, humorous, and relatable, especially when talking about extreme or frustrating situations like intense heat. It helps convey strong feelings and paint a more vivid picture.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Figurative Language</strong>: Uses words or expressions with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metaphor</strong>: Directly compares two unlike things without using "like" or "as."
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue: "they’re basically <strong>giant saunas</strong>!"</em> (Comparing hot regions to saunas.)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hyperbole</strong>: A figure of speech that involves an exaggerated statement or claim not meant to be taken literally, used for emphasis or humor.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Examples from dialogue:</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"It’s like the <strong>whole world is melting!</strong>"</li>
                        <li>"I’m wondering if I should just <strong>pack a personal ice maker</strong>."</li>
                        <li>"People are starting to <strong>cook eggs on the sidewalks</strong>."</li>
                        <li>"Her electric bill is going to be <strong>astronomical</strong>."</li>
                        <li>"Better safe than <strong>spontaneously combusting</strong>."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
