Alice: Hey Bob, it's Alice! Did I wake you up? It's 10 AM!
Bob: Uh, Alice? No, no, just... contemplating the ceiling. What's up?
Alice: I'm just calling to ask... what's your favorite type of cheese? It's important.
Bob: My *favorite type of cheese*? You called me for cheese? I thought it was an emergency!
Alice: It *is* an emergency! I'm making a sandwich, and I need expert advice.
Bob: Okay, okay. For sandwiches, definitely cheddar. Sharp cheddar.
Alice: Ooh, good choice! My phone was almost dead, so I called before it died completely.
Bob: Smart move. So, you're making a cheese sandwich? Just cheese?
Alice: And a little mustard! Are you busy? Or still contemplating the ceiling?
Bob: I was about to call you, actually. To ask if you wanted to watch a movie later.
Alice: What a coincidence! We're practically telepathic, Bob!
Bob: Or you just have excellent timing. Anyway, what movie do you want to see?
Alice: Let me think... I'll call you back in five minutes with an idea. My battery is at 1%!
Bob: Oh no! Quick! Before it dies! Don't forget the sharp cheddar!
Alice: Haha, never! Talk soon, Bob! *beep*
