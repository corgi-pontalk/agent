    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, you won't believe what I was just reading about!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice, let me guess, another article about why my cat secretly judges me?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Close! It's about human brain mapping projects. Apparently, scientists are trying to create incredibly detailed maps of the brain.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Oh, like a Google Maps for grey matter? So you can find the shortcut to the coffee machine directly through my subconscious?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Exactly! But way more complex. They're trying to understand how different parts of the brain work together and what each region does.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Right. I just hope they find the 'where did I put my keys?' region soon. That'd be a Nobel Prize for me, personally.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Tell me about it! Or the 'why do I crave chocolate at 3 AM?' pathway. That's a crucial one!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: I'd pay good money to have <i>that</i> part mapped and then, perhaps, surgically removed from my brain's operating system.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Imagine if they could actually map every single neuron and connection. We're talking about billions of neurons and trillions of connections!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: That sounds like a colossal undertaking. Like trying to map every single internet cable in the world, but if each cable could also spontaneously decide to become a cat video.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Pretty much! They call these maps 'connectomes.' It's about understanding consciousness, memory, and how diseases like Alzheimer's develop.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: So, one day, they might be able to download my memories? Maybe delete that embarrassing high school incident?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Theoretically, maybe! But we're a <i>long</i> way from that. For now, it's more about understanding the brain's fundamental structure and function.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Sounds like a fascinating but slightly terrifying future. Are they going to find the 'procrastination' center?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: If they do, Bob, I'll be the first in line to have mine rewired!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Human Brain Mapping Projects are ambitious scientific initiatives aimed at comprehensively understanding the structure and function of the human brain. Major efforts include the U.S. BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) and the European Human Brain Project.</p>
    <p>These projects utilize advanced technologies such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging), electrophysiology, and computational modeling to create detailed maps of neural circuits, identify specific brain regions responsible for various functions, and trace the connections between them â€“ often referred to as a "connectome."</p>
    <p>The goals are wide-ranging: to deepen our understanding of cognitive processes like memory, learning, and consciousness, to develop new treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, depression), and to inspire new computing architectures. While significant progress has been made in developing tools and mapping parts of the brain, a complete, neuron-by-neuron map of the entire human brain remains a colossal undertaking and a long-term goal due to its immense complexity.</p>
