        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, you wouldn't believe the tragedy that just unfolded in my bathroom. My shower practically coughed out a single lukewarm droplet!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oh, Alice, the horror! Was it perhaps a tiny water gnome protesting your excessive shampoo usage? Or did your landlord finally <span class="key-phrase">cut corners</span> on the water pressure *again*?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> It felt like a protest, alright. But seriously, it got me thinking. We complain about weak showers, but imagine not having *any* clean water at all.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Exactly! I was just reading an article this morning. Did you know <span class="key-phrase">billions of people lack access to safely managed drinking water</span>? It's <span class="key-phrase">mind-boggling</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Billions? That's… a lot of <span class="key-phrase">parched throats</span>. Here I am debating between sparkling or still, and others are praying for a muddy puddle. Talk about perspective shift!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> It really <span class="key-phrase">puts things into perspective</span>, doesn't it? It's not just about drinking, either. <span class="key-phrase">Sanitation and hygiene</span> are huge problems too without reliable water sources.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> So, like, no hand-washing after a trip to the, uh, *facilities*? That's just asking for trouble. My inner germaphobe is screaming.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Precisely. Contaminated water leads to all sorts of <span class="key-phrase">waterborne diseases</span>, which disproportionately affect children. It's a <span class="key-phrase">vicious cycle</span> of illness and poverty.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Gosh, I always thought it was mainly about drought in deserts. But it's more complex, isn't it? Like <span class="key-phrase">aging infrastructure</span> and pollution?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Absolutely. Lack of investment, <span class="key-phrase">climate change impacts</span> like extreme floods and droughts, and industrial pollution all <span class="key-phrase">play a part</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> So, what can ordinary mortals like us even do, Bob? Start collecting rainwater in our teacups?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Well, supporting organizations that work on <span class="key-phrase">water conservation and infrastructure projects</span> is a start. And being mindful of our own water usage, even if it feels like <span class="key-phrase">a drop in the ocean</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> A drop in the ocean… ha! Good one. But you're right. Maybe my dramatic shower struggle was a sign. I should probably <span class="key-phrase">turn off the tap</span> when I brush my teeth.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> See? Small steps, Alice. Small steps. We can't solve it overnight, but awareness is the first splash.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> First splash. I like that. So, no more hour-long shower concerts for me then? My neighbors will be thrilled.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Access to clean water is a fundamental human right, yet it remains a significant global challenge. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, billions of people worldwide still lack safely managed drinking water at home.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approximately 2 billion people do not have safely managed drinking water services.</li>
            <li>Around 3.6 billion people lack safely managed sanitation services.</li>
            <li>Contaminated drinking water causes over 1 million deaths each year, primarily from diarrhoeal diseases, with young children being most vulnerable.</li>
            <li>The problem is exacerbated by factors such as climate change (leading to droughts and floods), inadequate or <span class="key-phrase">aging infrastructure</span>, pollution from industrial and agricultural activities, and rapid urbanization.</li>
            <li>Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" – by 2030 requires substantial investment and concerted global effort.</li>
            <li>Efforts include developing new water sources, improving existing infrastructure, implementing <span class="key-phrase">water conservation</span> strategies, and promoting hygiene education.</li>
        </ul>
