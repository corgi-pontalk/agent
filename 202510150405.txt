Alice: Hi Bob, what are you doing?
Bob: Oh, hi Alice! I'm trying to beat this level in my new game. It's super hard!
Alice: Really? What game is it? Is it one of those monster-fighting games?
Bob: Kind of! It's 'Dragon Slayer 3'. The dragon just ate my magic boots again!
Alice: Haha, sounds painful for your boots! Can I watch? Maybe I can give you some 'expert' advice.
Bob: You? Expert advice? Last time you played, you walked your character into a wall for five minutes!
Alice: That was strategy! I was checking the wall for secret passages! And it was a long time ago.
Bob: Sure, 'strategy'. Anyway, come here. See? This big red dragon, Sparky, keeps breathing fire.
Alice: Sparky? That's a cute name for a fire-breathing beast!
Bob: Don't let the name fool you. He's terrible! Look, I need to get the golden sword.
Alice: Ah, the golden sword! Is it hidden in that giant mushroom?
Bob: No, that's just a regular, bouncy mushroom. The sword is usually near the 'Beware of Gnomes' sign.
Alice: Of course! Everywhere there are gnomes, there is treasure. Classic game logic.
Bob: Exactly! Now, if only Sparky would take a nap...
Alice: Or if you could bribe him with a shiny coin?
Bob: Hmm, worth a try! If I had any shiny coins left after buying these magic boots he ate!
