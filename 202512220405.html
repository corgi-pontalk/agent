        <p><b>Bob</b>: Ideally, yes. Iron your shirt, maybe. And try to arrive on time.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: On time... or ten minutes early to show enthusiasm?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Ten minutes early is perfect! Shows you're keen.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Okay, clothes, timing. What about questions? What if they ask me something super hard?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: They usually start with "Tell me about yourself." Practice a short, positive answer.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: "I like pizza and long naps." Is that positive?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: (Chuckles) Maybe something more about your skills or experience. Like, "I'm a hard worker and quick learner."</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Oh! Right. And what about my weaknesses? I have so many!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Choose a small one you're working on, like "Sometimes I get too excited about new projects."</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Haha, good one! Okay, Bob, you're a lifesaver. No sweatpants, on time, positive answers. I can do this!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-points">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Present Simple for General Facts and Habits</b>
                <p>We use the present simple tense to talk about things that are generally true or that happen regularly. It's great for stating facts or common practices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Example from dialogue</i>: "They <b>usually start</b> with 'Tell me about yourself.'" (This is a common habit of interviewers.)</li>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "Job interviews <b>are</b> important for getting work." (This is a general truth.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Imperatives for Giving Advice or Instructions</b>
                <p>Imperative verbs are used to give commands, make requests, or offer advice directly. They usually start with the base form of the verb.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Example from dialogue</i>: "First, <b>breathe</b>. Second, <b>remember</b> the basics." (Direct advice from Bob to Alice.)</li>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "<b>Look</b> presentable." (An instruction for an interview.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Using 'have' for Future Scheduled Events</b>
                <p>While 'have' is a present simple verb, it can be used to talk about future events that are already planned or scheduled, like appointments or fixed arrangements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Example from dialogue</i>: "I <b>have</b> a job interview tomorrow!" (The interview is a fixed, scheduled event in the near future.)</li>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "We <b>have</b> a meeting at 3 PM on Friday."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Adjectives for Describing Feelings and Qualities</b>
                <p>Adjectives describe nouns (people, places, things) and can tell us how someone feels or what something is like. They are essential for expressing emotions or qualities.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Example from dialogue</i>: "I'm so <b>nervous</b>." (Describes Alice's feeling.)</li>
                    <li><i>Example from dialogue</i>: "This one's <b>important</b>!" (Describes the quality of the interview.)</li>
                    <li><i>Example</i>: "She is a <b>quick learner</b> and a <b>hard worker</b>." (Describes positive qualities.)</li>
