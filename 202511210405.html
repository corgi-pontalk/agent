    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: Bob, is that really you? Welcome back! I almost didn't recognize you without a giant camera around your neck.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: Haha, Alice! Good to see you too. The camera is safely packed. And guess what? I brought you something!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: Oh, a souvenir for <em>me</em>? You're too kind! Is it something edible? I'm starving.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: Better than edible! It's... a mini replica of the leaning tower of Pisa, but it's <em>also</em> a bottle opener!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: Wow, Bob! A leaning tower <em>and</em> a bottle opener? My kitchen needs this absurdity. Thanks!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: And for myself, I got this amazing hat! It's shaped like a giant pretzel. Very traditional, I assure you.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: A pretzel hat? Bob, are you planning to open a German bakery or just confuse pigeons?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: It's stylish! And practical. Keeps the sun off. And it makes people smile. See? <em>(Puts it on.)</em></p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: Okay, you <em>do</em> look like a giant snack. But I admit, it made <em>me</em> smile. What other treasures did you find?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: Oh, just this lovely snow globe. It has tiny, glittery spaghetti inside. For Rome!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: Spaghetti snow globe? That's... surprisingly creative. Do you shake it and wish for dinner?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: Exactly! And it never goes bad. It's the perfect souvenir. No calories, either!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: You really have a knack for finding the most unique souvenirs. My fridge is still recovering from your last magnet collection.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: Exactly! Souvenirs should tell a story, even if the story is 'Bob bought a pretzel hat'.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker alice">Alice</span>: Well, your stories are always entertaining. Thanks again for the leaning tower bottle opener, Bob!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker bob">Bob</span>: Anytime, Alice! Next trip, I'll find you a croissant-shaped umbrella!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Souvenirs are objects bought and kept as a reminder of a place you visited or an event you experienced. They can also be gifts for friends and family back home. People often buy them when they travel to new cities, countries, or even famous local attractions.</p>
    <p>Common souvenirs include magnets for the fridge, keychains, small statues or replicas of famous landmarks, postcards, t-shirts, and local crafts. Sometimes, people buy local food items or sweets as souvenirs. While some prefer practical items, many enjoy quirky or humorous souvenirs that bring a smile or tell a unique story about their trip, just like Bob's pretzel hat or spaghetti snow globe.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Simple for General Truths and Habits</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>The Present Simple tense is used to talk about things that are generally true, facts, or habits and routines.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + Verb (base form or -s/-es for third person singular)</p>
        <p><em>From the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"It <strong>keeps</strong> the sun off." (A general truth about the hat's function.)</li>
            <li>"It never <strong>goes</strong> bad." (A general truth about the snow globe.)</li>
            <li>"Souvenirs <strong>should tell</strong> a story." (A general belief or advice.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> Water <strong>boils</strong> at 100 degrees Celsius. She always <strong>drinks</strong> coffee in the morning.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Present Continuous for Current Plans/Actions</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>The Present Continuous tense is used to talk about actions happening now, or plans for the near future.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + am/is/are + Verb-ing</p>
        <p><em>From the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Are you <strong>planning</strong> to open a German bakery...?" (Asking about a future plan.)</li>
            <li>"My fridge is still <strong>recovering</strong>..." (An ongoing action/state.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> I <strong>am meeting</strong> my friends tomorrow. They <strong>are studying</strong> for an exam right now.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Past Simple for Completed Actions</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>The Past Simple tense is used to talk about actions that started and finished at a specific time in the past.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + Verb (past form, regular or irregular)</p>
        <p><em>From the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I <strong>brought</strong> you something!" (The action of bringing is complete.)</li>
            <li>"I <strong>got</strong> this amazing hat!" (The action of getting is complete.)</li>
            <li>"It <strong>made</strong> me smile." (The action of making someone smile is complete.)</li>
            <li>"What other treasures <strong>did you find</strong>?" (Asking about completed actions of finding.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> We <strong>visited</strong> London last year. She <strong>ate</strong> pizza for dinner.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Modal Verb "Should" for Recommendations/Advice</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>"Should" is a modal verb used to give advice, make recommendations, or express obligation (though a weaker one than "must").</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + should + base form of verb</p>
        <p><em>From the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Souvenirs <strong>should tell</strong> a story..." (Bob's recommendation or belief about souvenirs.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> You <strong>should study</strong> hard for your test. We <strong>should try</strong> that new restaurant.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>5. "Too" vs. "Very"</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Both "too" and "very" are adverbs that intensify adjectives or other adverbs. However, they have different implications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Very:</strong> Simply means "a lot" or "to a great degree." It's neutral and usually positive.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> The weather is <strong>very</strong> nice today. This book is <strong>very</strong> interesting.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Too:</strong> Means "more than enough" or "excessively." It often implies a negative consequence or something undesirable.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> It's <strong>too</strong> hot to go outside. This coffee is <strong>too</strong> sweet (it has more sugar than I want).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>From the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"You're <strong>too</strong> kind!" (Alice means Bob is *so* generous, perhaps more than necessary, in a positive way here, but it still carries the meaning of 'excessively'.)</li>
            <li>"Very traditional." (Simply emphasizes the degree of tradition.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>6. "Either" in Negative Sentences</h3>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>"Either" can be used at the end of a negative sentence to mean "also not." It's similar to "too" in affirmative sentences, but for negatives.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Negative sentence + either</p>
        <p><em>From the dialogue:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"No calories, <strong>either</strong>!" (Meaning: it also doesn't have calories, similar to "it's not bad and it also doesn't have calories.")</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> I don't like coffee, and my sister doesn't like tea, <strong>either</strong>. He can't swim, and I can't dance, <strong>either</strong>.</p>
    </div>
