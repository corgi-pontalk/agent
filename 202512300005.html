    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, did you see that documentary last night about human trafficking prevention? It really got me thinking.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, Alice, I did! Pretty heavy stuff, but super important. I was wondering what <em>we</em> could even do.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! I mean, beyond donating, what if we started a 'Neighborhood Ninja' watch group?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Neighborhood Ninjas? Alice, are we talking about stealthily patrolling the streets in black turtlenecks?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, maybe less 'ninja' and more 'super observant community members'! We'd spot suspicious activities, you know, like someone trying to sell 'discounted' exotic parrots from a trench coat.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: That's oddly specific. But I like the spirit! What about a 'Secret Handshake of Safety' campaign? If someone flashes the wrong handshake, we know they're up to no good!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, that's brilliant! Or completely bonkers, I can't decide. We could combine it! The Ninjas patrol, and the Secret Handshake identifies potential victims or perpetrators.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It's a multi-pronged approach! We'd need code words, too. Like, 'The pineapple is ripe' means 'Alert the authorities!'</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: And 'The squirrel has a tiny hat' means 'I need coffee, immediately, this surveillance is tiring.'</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perfect! But seriously, spreading awareness about online safety and how traffickers recruit is probably the most effective thing.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Yeah, you're right. Our ninja-handshake plan might be a <em>tad</em> elaborate. Maybe we start with a social media campaign, sharing tips from reputable organizations?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Definitely. We could call it 'Operation: Real-World Vigilance.' Less black turtlenecks, more share buttons.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I suppose. No tiny hats for squirrels, either?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: We can save the tiny hats for our 'post-prevention-success' celebration. Imagine, a world without trafficking, and squirrels in tiny hats!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Now <em>that's</em> a world worth fighting for, Bob.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Human trafficking is a grave global issue, a form of modern slavery that involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to exploit individuals for various purposes, including forced labor and sexual exploitation. Prevention efforts are crucial and multi-faceted, focusing on raising public awareness, educating vulnerable populations about risks, identifying and supporting victims, strengthening law enforcement against traffickers, and addressing the root causes like poverty and lack of opportunity.</p>
    <p>Many organizations worldwide work to combat trafficking through campaigns that teach online safety, encourage reporting suspicious activities, and provide resources for those at risk. These efforts emphasize community vigilance, international cooperation, and policy changes to protect human rights and dismantle trafficking networks.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Suggestions and Possibilities (Could, Might)</h3>
    <p>Modal verbs like "could" and "might" are often used to suggest ideas or express possibilities without being overly assertive. They show that something is an option or a potential outcome.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Could</strong>: Used to suggest possibilities, abilities, or make polite suggestions.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"What if we <strong>could</strong> all work together?"</em> (Possibility/Suggestion)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"We <strong>could</strong> start a neighbourhood watch group."</em> (Suggestion)</p></li>
        <li><strong>Might</strong>: Used to express a weaker possibility or a less certain suggestion.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"Our plan <strong>might</strong> be a tad elaborate."</em> (Weaker possibility)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"I <strong>might</strong> go to the library later, if I have time."</em> (Less certain)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Conditional Sentences (Type 1: Real Conditional)</h3>
    <p>Conditional sentences express a condition and its result. Type 1 conditionals describe a real and possible situation in the future or present and its likely result. They use the present simple in the 'if' clause and 'will' or other modal verbs (like 'can', 'may', 'should') in the main clause.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure: If + Present Simple, Will/Modal + Base Verb</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>If</strong> someone <strong>flashes</strong> the wrong handshake, we <strong>know</strong> they're up to no good!"</em></p>
            <p>(Here, 'we know' acts as the result for a present condition, implying a certain outcome if the condition is met.)</p></li>
        <li><p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>If</strong> it <strong>rains</strong> tomorrow, we <strong>will stay</strong> home."</em></p></li>
        <li><p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>If</strong> you <strong>study</strong> hard, you <strong>can pass</strong> the exam."</em></p></li>
    </ul>
