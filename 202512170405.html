        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hi Bob, guess what? I just saw a movie about Westonia, and it made me think about our cultures!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, hey Alice! What did it make you think about?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Well, in the movie, people eat pizza with forks! We just use our hands for almost everything in Araland. It's much faster!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Haha, some people do, but mostly we pick it up. Eating with hands for everything sounds… messy sometimes!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Not really! We have special wet wipes for our famous 'Spicy Noodle Soup'. It's a national sport to eat it without making a mess!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: A national sport? That's amazing! Do you have any big festivals in Araland?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh yes! We have the 'Laughing Lantern Festival'. People make huge lanterns that look like funny faces, and then we have a parade. It's so bright and happy!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: That sounds super fun! We have Halloween, where people dress up in scary costumes and ask for candy. It's quite different!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Scary? But why scary? We like happy and funny! What about greetings? Do you bow or something?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: We usually just shake hands or hug close friends. No bowing, mostly. It depends on the situation.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: We do a little dance when we meet new people! It's called the 'Welcome Wobble'. Everyone does it!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: A dance? That's so unique! I'd love to try the Welcome Wobble sometime.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: You should! It's a great icebreaker. Another thing, we always take off our shoes before entering a house. It's a very old tradition.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, we do that sometimes too, especially if it's muddy outside. But it's not always required.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: For us, it's a sign of respect for the home. And always offer tea to guests! Always!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Offering tea is nice. See, some things are similar, even if others are wildly different! This is fascinating!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Right? Our cultures are like two different kinds of amazing desserts. Both great, just different ingredients!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! We should share more about them.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Talking about your culture is a wonderful way to connect with people from different backgrounds. It helps you understand others better and share what makes your home unique. When you describe your country's customs, food, or festivals, you not only practice your English but also open up a fascinating world for your friends!</p>
    <p>This dialogue shows how friends can share cultural differences and similarities in a fun and lighthearted way. Don't be afraid to ask questions or explain traditions from your own culture!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Present Simple Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the Present Simple tense to talk about habits, routines, facts, and general truths. This is perfect for describing cultural customs!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Form:</b> Subject + Base form of verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it)</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. "Usually" for Habits and Routines</h3>
        <p>"Usually" is an adverb of frequency that means "most of the time." We use it to talk about things that happen regularly as a custom or habit.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Placement:</b> Before the main verb, or after "to be" verbs.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Comparing with "Different" and "Similar"</h3>
        <p>These words help us talk about how things are alike or not alike.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Different from:</b> When two things are not the same.</li>
            <li><b>Similar to:</b> When two things are almost the same or share characteristics.</li>
