    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, guess what kind of adventure I embarked on this morning?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice, knowing you, probably wrestling a giant squirrel for the last croissant. What is it?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Close! It involved a bicycle, a very steep hill, and a client who apparently lives at the very top of Mount Everest... for a ten-dollar delivery gig. My legs are officially on strike.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Ah, the glamorous life of a gig worker! Sounds like you've been living the dream, or rather, pedaling the nightmare.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! And the dream, Bob, comes without health insurance or paid sick leave. My bike chain snapped halfway, and I swear, the customer messaged me asking if I could also pick up their dry cleaning.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Classic! They always want a little extra, don't they? Like we're their personal assistants on wheels.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Tell me about it. Sometimes I feel like I'm running a one-person circus, juggling multiple apps, chasing payments, and praying my internet doesn't flake out during a crucial video call.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It's that unpredictable income that gets me. One month you're living like a king, the next you're rationing instant noodles. There’s no steady paycheck to look forward to.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely. And the hustle culture pressure is real. You constantly feel like you should be doing more, taking on more, just to stay afloat. My "free time" is mostly spent looking for my next gig.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Don't forget the 'no benefits' part. No pension, no holiday pay... it's like being a perpetual intern, except you actually have critical responsibilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You've hit the nail on the head! It’s all about flexibility, until you realize that flexibility usually means <em>their</em> flexibility, not yours.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> And the ratings! One bad review because the coffee was lukewarm after a 20-minute uphill battle, and suddenly your income stream takes a hit. The injustice!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's a Wild West out there, Bob. Every day feels like a new challenge. But hey, at least I get to be my own boss... mostly.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "Mostly" being the operative word! I get it though, the freedom can be appealing, despite the constant tightrope walk.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Precisely. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think my legs just filed for divorce from the rest of my body. Time for an ice bath and a very long nap.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> You earned it, Alice. Maybe I should start a gig delivering ice baths to weary gig workers. There's a niche!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The global gig economy, characterized by short-term contracts or freelance work, has seen explosive growth in recent years, driven by digital platforms that connect workers with clients. While offering flexibility and supplementary income opportunities, it also presents significant challenges. Workers often face unpredictable income streams, a lack of traditional employment benefits such as health insurance, paid leave, and retirement plans, and limited job security. There's also the pressure of constant performance monitoring through ratings and reviews, which can directly impact future work. These issues raise questions about worker exploitation, fair compensation, and the future of work, prompting governments and organizations worldwide to seek better regulations and protections for gig workers.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Modal Verbs for Speculation and Deduction (e.g., <em>must, might, could, should</em>)</strong></p>
    <p>Modal verbs help express different levels of certainty or likelihood about a situation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Must</strong> (strong deduction/high certainty): Used when you are almost sure something is true based on evidence.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "She <strong>must</strong> be exhausted after that delivery." (I'm almost sure she is).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Might / May / Could</strong> (possibility/less certainty): Used when something is possible but not certain.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "It <strong>might</strong> rain later, so take an umbrella." "He <strong>could</strong> be stuck in traffic." (It's possible).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Should</strong> (expectation/recommendation): Used to say what is expected or what is a good idea.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Maybe I <strong>should</strong> start a gig delivering ice baths..." (Bob is suggesting an idea).</li>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "You <strong>should</strong> get some rest." (It's a good idea).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. Phrasal Verb: <em>Flake out</em></strong></p>
    <p>A phrasal verb combines a verb with a preposition or adverb (or both) to create a new meaning. "Flake out" can have several meanings depending on the context:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To fail to happen, to give up, or to abandon plans.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "He was supposed to help, but he <strong>flaked out</strong> at the last minute."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To collapse from exhaustion or to relax completely.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example:</em> "After working all day, I just want to go home and <strong>flake out</strong> on the couch."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In the context of technology, to stop working or malfunction.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "...praying my internet doesn't <strong>flake out</strong> during a crucial video call." (Meaning: hoping the internet doesn't fail).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
