Alice: Hey, Bob! Long time no see! How's university life treating you?
Bob: Alice! It's... an adventure. My roommate just tried to cook pasta in the coffee maker.
Alice: (Laughs) Oh no! Is that a common thing?
Bob: Apparently, when you're hungry and don't own a pot. Or a brain, maybe.
Alice: At least you'll never be bored. What about classes? Are they tough?
Bob: Some are. My history professor talks so slowly, I think even the clock falls asleep.
Alice: Sounds like a challenge to stay awake! My biggest challenge is finding my classes. The campus map is like a secret treasure hunt.
Bob: Tell me about it! I ended up in a chemistry lab instead of a literature lecture last week. They almost gave me a beaker.
Alice: (Giggles) Did you learn anything useful? Like, how to make coffee that *isn't* made in a coffee maker?
Bob: Not really. But I did learn that I should probably get more sleep. I keep confusing my backpack for a pillow.
Alice: That's classic! Are you enjoying anything, though? Any fun activities?
Bob: Oh, definitely! The university has a really fun board game club. And the pizza place near campus is amazing.
Alice: Pizza and board games? Sounds like a perfect university survival strategy!
Bob: It is. Much better than coffee-maker pasta.
Alice: I agree! Well, good luck with the treasure hunt and the sleeping clocks!
Bob: You too, Alice! Don't let the beakers get you!
