        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, are you still coming to the movie night on Friday?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Friday? Oh no, Alice, I thought it was Thursday! My brain's a calendar catastrophe.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A calendar catastrophe? It's literally written on the invite! Friday, 7 PM. You mixed up Tuesday and Wednesday last week too.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Did I? I swear I thought Tuesday was 'Taco Tuesday,' not 'Terrible Timetable Tuesday' for my meeting.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! And then you showed up for brunch on Sunday thinking it was Saturday.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, *that* one was forgivable. All weekend days feel the same when you're relaxing!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Not when you're hungry! So, Friday for the movie. Got it?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Friday. F-R-I-D-A-Y. The day before Saturday, the day after Thursday. Yes, I think I'm getting there.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Good. Because if you miss it, you'll have to wait until next Monday for another chance to socialize with us.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Monday? Ugh, don't even say the M-word. Monday feels like the universe's way of telling us the fun is officially over.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Tell me about it. But then there's Tuesday, a bit better, and Wednesday, 'hump day' â€“ almost to the weekend!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> And Thursday is just Friday's warm-up act. It's like, 'Almost there, but not quite!'</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, true. So, to recap: Friday movie, not Thursday. Don't show up on Wednesday.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Understood. My internal calendar has been temporarily recalibrated. I promise not to show up on a Sunday.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Excellent. See you then, Bob! And maybe check your phone's calendar once in a while.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <div class="current-situation">
            <p>The days of the week are fundamental to daily life, organizing everything from work schedules and appointments to social gatherings and holidays. They are a universal concept for time management, helping us structure our lives and communicate effectively about when things happen. In English-speaking cultures, the week typically consists of five 'weekdays' (Monday to Friday) and 'the weekend' (Saturday and Sunday). Understanding and correctly using the days is crucial for effective communication and avoiding mix-ups, as humorously demonstrated in the dialogue!</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <div class="grammar-points">
            <p>Here are some important grammar rules to remember when using days of the week:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Capitalization:</strong> Days of the week are proper nouns in English, meaning they always start with a capital letter.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> <em>monday</em> (incorrect) vs. <strong>Monday</strong> (correct).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Preposition 'On':</strong> When referring to a specific day or a recurring action on a specific day, we usually use the preposition "on."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example (specific day):</em> I have a meeting <strong>on</strong> Tuesday.</li>
                        <li><em>Example (recurring action):</em> We go to the market <strong>on</strong> Saturdays.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Referring to Recurring Actions:</strong> To talk about actions that happen regularly on a certain day, you can use "every" or add an "s" to the day with "on".</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> I go to the gym <strong>every Monday</strong>.</li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> I go to the gym <strong>on Mondays</strong>. (Both mean the same: regularly on Monday.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Omitting Prepositions with 'Next', 'Last', 'This':</strong> When using words like "next," "last," or "this" before a day of the week (or a time period like "weekend"), you generally do not need a preposition.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> See you <strong>next Friday</strong>. (Not: See you <em>on next Friday</em>.)</li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> We met <strong>last Sunday</strong>. (Not: We met <em>on last Sunday</em>.)</li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> What are you doing <strong>this weekend</strong>? (Not: What are you doing <em>on this weekend</em>?)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
