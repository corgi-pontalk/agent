    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, you won't believe what happened this morning!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, Bob, let me guess. Did your shower suddenly turn into a single, sorrowful tear?</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Worse! My landlord *put up* a notice about *conserving water*. I barely managed to rinse my toothbrush!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: *Tell me about it*! I almost had to dry-clean my face. It's like we're living in a desert oasis... without the oasis.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Right? I was just thinking, is this just *our* building, or is the whole city turning into a giant sand dune?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Nah, it's bigger than that, Bob. I was reading an article about *global water scarcity* last night. It's a real *challenge*.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Global? So it's not just my landlord being cheap? Phew. But wait, that's actually worse.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! *Potable water* is becoming a *precious resource* in so many places. It's not just about *turning off* the tap while brushing.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, no more hour-long, contemplative showers, even on weekends? My dreams are *shattering*.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Pretty much! *Water stress* affects billions. Think about agriculture, sanitation...</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Agriculture? Does that mean my beloved avocado toast is in danger? This is getting serious.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Possibly! And it's driven by *climate change*, population growth, even *pollution*.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Wow. I always thought water was just... *there*. Like air, but wetter.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Not always, not everywhere. We really *need* better *water management* strategies, and individuals *should* do their part too.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, maybe I *should* start collecting rainwater for my morning coffee? Just in case.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Might not be a bad idea, Bob, might not be a bad idea.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Global water scarcity is a growing crisis where the demand for clean, fresh water exceeds its available supply. While 70% of the Earth is covered by water, only a tiny fraction (about 2.5%) is freshwater, and most of that is locked in glaciers or deep underground, making it inaccessible. This means that *potable water*, safe for drinking and daily use, is a truly *precious resource*.</p>
    <p>The challenges leading to water scarcity are multifaceted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Altered weather patterns, including prolonged droughts and unpredictable rainfall, significantly reduce water availability in many regions.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> As the global population expands, so does the demand for water for drinking, sanitation, and food production.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and inadequate wastewater treatment contaminate existing freshwater sources, rendering them unsafe for use.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsustainable Water Management:</strong> Over-extraction of groundwater, inefficient irrigation practices, and poor infrastructure contribute to the depletion of water reserves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*Water stress* impacts billions worldwide, leading to food insecurity, health crises due to lack of sanitation, economic instability, and even conflict. Addressing this challenge requires comprehensive *water management* strategies, international cooperation, and individual efforts towards *conserving water*.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global water scarcity</strong>: The worldwide problem of not having enough clean, safe water.
            <em>Example: Many organizations are working to address the issue of <strong>global water scarcity</strong>.</em></li>

            <em>Example: Regions experiencing severe <strong>water stress</strong> often face challenges in agriculture.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Climate change</strong>: Long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, largely caused by human activities.

        <li><strong>Water management</strong>: The process of planning, developing, distributing, and managing the optimum use of water resources.
            <em>Example: Effective <strong>water management</strong> is crucial for sustainable development.</em></li>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Advice and Necessity: 'should', 'need to', 'must'</h3>
    <p>Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express necessity, possibility, permission, or obligation. Here, we focus on those used for giving advice or stating a necessity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Should</strong>: Used for giving advice or making a recommendation. It suggests an action is good or advisable, but not a strict obligation.
            <em>Example: We <strong>should</strong> turn off the tap while brushing our teeth. (It's a good idea)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Need to</strong>: Expresses necessity or a requirement. It's stronger than 'should' and implies that an action is important to achieve a goal or avoid a problem.
            <em>Example: We <strong>need to</strong> develop better water management strategies. (It's necessary for survival)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Must</strong>: Expresses strong obligation or a command. It is the strongest of the three and implies something is absolutely essential.
            <em>Example: You <strong>must</strong> conserve water during a drought. (It's a strict rule or vital necessity)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Present Perfect vs. Simple Past</h3>
    <p>These two tenses are often confused, but they convey different meanings about time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Past</strong>: Used for actions that started and finished at a specific time in the past. The time is usually mentioned or implied.
            <em>Example: Bob's landlord <strong>put up</strong> a notice this morning. (A completed action at a specific past time)</em>
            <em>Example: I <strong>read</strong> an article last night. (A completed action at a specific past time)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Present Perfect</strong>: Used for actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past, or actions that started in the past and continue up to the present. It connects the past to the present.
            <em>Example: Global water scarcity <strong>has become</strong> a serious challenge. (Started in the past, continues now, without a specific past time mentioned)</em>
            <em>Example: Scientists <strong>have observed</strong> significant changes in rainfall patterns. (Action happened in the past, but the effect is still relevant now)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Common Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both), which together have a meaning different from the individual words. They are very common in spoken English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Put up</strong>: To display something on a wall or other surface.
            <em>Example: The students <strong>put up</strong> their artwork in the hallway.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Turn into</strong>: To change or develop into something different.
            <em>Example: The caterpillar will eventually <strong>turn into</strong> a butterfly.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Turn off</strong>: To stop a machine or a light from operating.
            <em>Example: Please <strong>turn off</strong> the lights when you leave the room.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Tell me about it!</strong>: An idiom used to express strong agreement or shared experience with someone's complaint or problem.
            <em>Example: "My internet is so slow today." "<strong>Tell me about it!</strong> Mine too."</em></li>
    </ul>
