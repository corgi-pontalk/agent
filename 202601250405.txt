Alice : Hey Bob, what are you watching? Is that... the news? Bob : Hi Alice! Yes, it's about the election. So many people talking! Alice : Oh, politics! I try to understand, but it's like a different language sometimes. Bob : I know, right? Like, who is that person? What are they saying about taxes? Alice : Exactly! And why are they always shouting? Can't they just have a nice cup of tea? Bob : Good point! Maybe they need a snack break. My cat understands politics better than me, I think. Alice : Your cat votes for naps, I bet. Bob : Definitely! And more food. Simple demands. Alice : Perhaps politicians should learn from your cat. Less shouting, more napping, more snacks. Bob : A world government run by cats. Now that's a platform I can support! Alice : Me too! Imagine the peace. No more long speeches, just purring. Bob : And debates would be chasing laser pointers. Alice : Yes! Much more entertaining. I'd watch that news! Bob : So, are we politically active now? Supporting the 'Cat Party'? Alice : Absolutely, Bob! The future is feline.
