Alice: Bob, what are you doing this afternoon? I really need to go clothes shopping!
Bob: Alice, shopping? Oh, no, not again! My wallet still has PTSD from your last trip.
Alice: Don't be silly! I just need a new top. And maybe some trousers. And possibly a jacketâ€¦
Bob: See? It always starts with "just one thing."
Alice: But I have nothing to wear! My closet is full, but nothing fits my _vibe_ today.
Bob: Your _vibe_? Is that like when my shirt says "weekend" but my pants say "I still need to do laundry"?
Alice: Exactly! So, are you coming? I need a second opinion. A _stylish_ second opinion.
Bob: Me? Stylish? My best fashion advice is "Is it clean?" and "Does it match my other clean clothes?"
Alice: Come on! It'll be fun. We can get ice cream afterward.
Bob: Ice cream? Okay, you got my attention. What kind of clothes are you looking for?
Alice: Something bright! Maybe a yellow dress? Or a floral skirt?
Bob: Yellow? Floral? My eyes! Are you trying to blind me in the fitting room?
Alice: Don't worry, I'll pick something nice for you too. A new t-shirt, perhaps?
Bob: Oh, no, no, no. My t-shirts are perfectly fine. They have character. And maybe a few questionable stains.
Alice: Perfect! Let's go then. My "vibe" is calling for retail therapy!
Bob: (Sighs) Lead the way, fashionista. Just promise we won't buy _everything_.
