Alice: Hi Bob! How are you? What are your plans for the weekend?
Bob: Oh, Alice! I'm doing great, thanks. My plans? Prepare for greatness! I'm going to train my cat.
Alice: Train your cat? What does that even mean? To fetch tiny mouse toys?
Bob: No, no! Much more ambitious! I'm teaching him to play the piano. Or at least, press the keys with his paws. It's a work in progress.
Alice: (Laughing) That soundsâ€¦ unique, Bob. Good luck with that! My weekend is a bit more normal.
Bob: Normal? How boring! Tell me!
Alice: I'm planning to finally clean my apartment. It's a disaster zone. Then, maybe watch some movies.
Bob: Cleaning? Movies? You're living life on the edge, Alice! Are you sure you don't want to join my cat's piano recital?
Alice: Tempting, but I think I'll stick to my disaster zone. Maybe I'll order pizza.
Bob: Pizza! Now you're talking! What kind of pizza?
Alice: Hmm, probably pepperoni. What about you after the piano lesson?
Bob: After the concert, I'll need a long nap. And maybe a snack. My cat demands payment in tuna.
Alice: Tuna for the artist, I see. Well, have a great time, Bob! And tell your cat I said "meow-sic to my ears!"
Bob: I will, Alice! You too! Don't work too hard cleaning.
Alice: I'll try not to! See you next week!
Bob: See you!
