    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you won't believe the article I just read about India!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh Bob, please tell me it's not another conspiracy theory about pigeons and global warming.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: No, no! It's about their foreign policy. Apparently, they're doing this "multi-alignment" thing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: "Multi-alignment"? Sounds like a yoga pose for diplomats. Are they trying to touch their toes to their ears while negotiating a trade deal?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Haha, kind of! It means they're not just sticking to one side, like during the Cold War. They're friends with everyone – the US, Russia, even eyeing closer ties with Europe and the Middle East.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, instead of being in an exclusive club, they've got a platinum membership to *every* club in town? From disco to chess club, they're in?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! They're like that one friend who's invited to *everyone's* party. It's about pragmatism, not strictly ideology.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Pragmatism. Got it. So, if there's a good deal on advanced fighter jets from one country, and a great offer on renewable energy technology from another, they'll take both, no questions asked?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Pretty much! And it's driven by their immense economic growth and strategic interests. They're becoming a massive player on the global stage.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: From "non-alignment" to "super-alignment" with a side of extra curry?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, the "non-alignment" of the past was more about not picking sides between superpowers. Now it's about picking *all* the useful sides. It's a strategic autonomy move.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Strategic autonomy... so they're basically saying, "We'll dance with whoever has the best beat, but we choose the playlist"?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: That's a fantastic analogy, Alice! They're definitely calling their own tunes on the global stage now. It's quite a fascinating evolution.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It really is. Sounds like good common sense, actually. Who wants to be stuck with just one friend group forever?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Precisely! And it makes perfect sense for a rising power like India to diversify its diplomatic portfolio.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>India's foreign policy has undergone a significant transformation, moving from its historical stance of "non-alignment" during the Cold War era to a more dynamic and pragmatic approach often described as "multi-alignment" or "strategic autonomy." This shift is largely a response to India's growing economic and strategic influence, as well as the evolving geopolitical landscape.</p>
    <p>Key aspects of this shift include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-alignment:</strong> India actively cultivates strong ties with multiple global powers and blocs (e.g., the United States, Russia, Europe, the Quad, Gulf nations, African countries) without committing to exclusive alliances. This allows it to leverage diverse partnerships for its national interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> The policy is driven by a focus on practical benefits, economic growth, and national security rather than rigid ideological alignment. Decisions are made based on what best serves India's interests in a given situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Autonomy:</strong> India emphasizes its right to independent decision-making on global issues, even when engaging with major powers. It seeks to maintain its freedom of action and avoid being drawn into one bloc's agenda.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Diplomacy:</strong> Economic interests play a central role, with India actively seeking trade agreements, foreign investments, and technological partnerships to fuel its development.</li>
        <li><strong>Global South Leadership:</strong> India increasingly positions itself as a voice and leader for developing nations, advocating for their concerns on the global stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Balancing Act:</strong> It skillfully manages complex relationships, such as maintaining its long-standing defense ties with Russia while deepening strategic partnerships with Western nations, particularly the US. It also navigates a challenging relationship with China.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This evolving foreign policy enables India to maximize its options, enhance its strategic space, and project its influence as a major rising power in the 21st century.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-alignment:</strong> The strategy of maintaining good relations with multiple countries or blocs, rather than aligning exclusively with one.
