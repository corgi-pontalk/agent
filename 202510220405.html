    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Oh, Bob, you look like you've seen a ghost! What's up?</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! You won't believe it. I just saw the <strong>tallest</strong> man ever!</p>
        <p>Alice: Taller than you? That's not hard, you're not exactly a skyscraper yourself, Bob! <em>(teasing)</em></p>
        <p>Bob: Hey! I'm average! But this guy... he was <strong>really tall</strong>. Like, super tall.</p>
        <p>Alice: How tall is "super tall"? Was he taller than a door frame?</p>
        <p>Bob: Almost! And he had bright <strong>red hair</strong>. Like a fiery sunset!</p>
        <p>Alice: Red hair, huh? Was it <strong>long or short</strong>?</p>
        <p>Bob: It was <strong>short</strong>, a bit spiky. And he had a funny little mustache.</p>
        <p>Alice: A mustache AND red, spiky hair? Sounds like a character from a cartoon!</p>
        <p>Bob: Exactly! Then I saw a woman with him. She was quite <strong>short</strong>.</p>
        <p>Alice: Short? Or just short compared to the giant?</p>
        <p>Bob: Good point! Next to him, she looked <strong>tiny</strong>. And she had <strong>long, dark brown hair</strong>. Very shiny.</p>
        <p>Alice: So, a tall, red-haired man and a short-looking woman with long, dark brown hair. Sounds like a fun pair!</p>
        <p>Bob: They were holding hands! Anyway, what about <strong>our</strong> friend, Mark? How would you describe him?</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh, Mark! He's not very tall, more on the <strong>short</strong> side. And he has <strong>blonde hair</strong>, usually a bit messy.</p>
        <p>Bob: Haha, yes, messy blonde hair is Mark's signature look! And he wears glasses.</p>
        <p>Alice: Right! And a really nice smile.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Describing people is a fundamental skill in English, helping you talk about friends, family, or even strangers you see every day. For beginners, focusing on basic physical characteristics like height and hair color is a great start. In everyday conversations, we often use simple adjectives to paint a quick picture for others, as Alice and Bob do in their chat. It's common to use expressions like "He is tall" or "She has red hair" to give a general idea of someone's appearance.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>tall</strong>: describes someone with a greater than average height.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: My brother is very <strong>tall</strong>.</span></li>
        <li><strong>short</strong>: describes someone with a smaller than average height.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: The little girl is <strong>short</strong>.</span></li>
        <li><strong>red hair</strong>: hair color, often bright or reddish-orange.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: He has bright <strong>red hair</strong>.</span></li>
        <li><strong>blonde hair</strong>: light yellow or golden-colored hair.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: She has beautiful <strong>blonde hair</strong>.</span></li>
        <li><strong>brown hair</strong>: hair color, ranging from light to dark brown.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: My friend has <strong>brown hair</strong> and green eyes.</span></li>
        <li><strong>dark hair</strong>: hair that is black or dark brown.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: The woman has <strong>dark hair</strong>.</span></li>
        <li><strong>long hair</strong>: hair that extends far down (e.g., past shoulders).
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: My sister has very <strong>long hair</strong>.</span></li>
        <li><strong>short hair</strong>: hair that does not extend far down (e.g., above ears).
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: He decided to get <strong>short hair</strong> for summer.</span></li>
        <li><strong>messy hair</strong>: hair that is untidy or not neatly styled.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: Mark often has <strong>messy hair</strong> in the morning.</span></li>
        <li><strong>What does X look like?</strong>: A question to ask for someone's physical description.
            <span class="example-sentence">Example: <strong>What does your brother look like?</strong></span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Verb "to be" (is/are) for height and general description:</strong>
            We use "is" or "are" when talking about someone's height or overall appearance.
            <br><em>Examples:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>He <strong>is tall</strong>.</li>
                <li>She <strong>is short</strong>.</li>
                <li>They <strong>are</strong> a fun pair.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Verb "to have" (has/have) for hair and other features:</strong>
            We use "has" (for he/she/it) or "have" (for I/you/we/they) when talking about someone's hair color, length, or other features like eyes, glasses, or a mustache.
            <br><em>Examples:</em>
            <ul>

                <li>I <strong>have brown hair</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Adjectives before nouns:</strong>
            In English, descriptive words (adjectives) usually come before the noun they describe.
            <br><em>Examples:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>a <strong>tall</strong> man (not "a man tall")</li>
                <li><strong>red</strong> hair (not "hair red")</li>
                <li>a <strong>funny little</strong> mustache</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Basic question word "What":</strong>
            We use "What" to ask for information, like a description.
            <br><em>Example:</em> <strong>What</strong> does he look like? (Asking for a description of his appearance)</li>
    </ul>
