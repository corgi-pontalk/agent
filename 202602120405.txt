Alice : Bob, you look like you've just seen a ghost, or maybe read a very long book! Bob : Alice! You got it! I just tried to read 'War and Peace.' It's... a real tome! Alice : A tome? Wow, big words! Were you trying to impress me with your new vocabulary? Bob : Maybe a little! I also learned about a 'protagonist.' That's the main good guy, right? Alice : Mostly, yes! The main character. And the 'antagonist ' is often the not-so-good guy who opposes them. Bob : Aha! So, in my life, I'm the protagonist, and my alarm clock is the antagonist! Alice : Haha, a perfect 'metaphor ' for early mornings! A metaphor is when you compare two different things without using 'like' or 'as'. Bob : So, my life is a 'narrative '? Alice : Indeed! A story. And your alarm clock's story is probably a short 'tragedy' every morning. Bob : And if I write about it, that's a 'memoir '? Alice : If it's about your own life, yes! Like a personal 'biography ' but written by you. Bob : So many words! I feel like I need a dictionary just to talk about books! Alice : You're getting there! You're building your vocabulary. Want to read a short novel together? Bob : Only if it has a happy ending! And not too many chapters. Alice : Deal! Let's find a fun 'fairy tale' or a light 'mystery' for starters. Bob : Great! My brain needs a break from 'epics'.
