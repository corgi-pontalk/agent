    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Bob, you won't believe what I just read! It's actually a bit disturbing.</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh no, Alice, not another <strong>doomsday scenario</strong> about alien invasions or self-aware toasters?</p>
        <p>Alice: Worse! They've found microplastics <strong>inside people</strong>. Like, actually *inside* us!</p>
        <p>Bob: Wait, what? Are you telling me I’m basically a <strong>human plastic bag</strong> now? Is that why I feel so… resilient?</p>
        <p>Alice: Don't joke! Scientists are finding them in our blood, organs, even placentas. It's everywhere.</p>
        <p>Bob: So, that "fresh ocean breeze" I was enjoying the other day probably came with a side of plastic confetti? No wonder my super-sight isn't kicking in!</p>
        <p>Alice: Exactly! We eat it, drink it, breathe it. Think of all the takeout containers, the synthetic clothes...</p>
        <p>Bob: My <strong>Achilles heel</strong>! My love for instant ramen has betrayed me. Maybe I should start eating only things grown in a <strong>pristine, air-filtered bubble</strong>.</p>
        <p>Alice: Good luck with that. Even the rain carries it. We're practically <strong>swimming in it</strong>.</p>
        <p>Bob: So, if I get a paper cut, will I <strong>bleed glitter</strong>? This explains so much about my sparkly personality!</p>
        <p>Alice: You're <strong>impossible</strong>! But seriously, it makes you think about what we're actually putting into our bodies.</p>
        <p>Bob: True. So, does this mean my eventual superhero name will be Captain Plastic? With powers of… well, resisting corrosion?</p>
        <p>Alice: More like Captain Concern! We really need to be more mindful.</p>
        <p>Bob: Right. Maybe it's time to invest in a personal, full-body microplastic filter. Or just embrace my <strong>inner Tupperware</strong>.</p>
        <p>Alice: I think I'll stick with water filters for now. And less plastic-wrapped everything. You should too!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Microplastics are tiny plastic particles, less than 5 millimeters in diameter, that come from the breakdown of larger plastic items, cosmetics, synthetic clothing, and industrial processes. These pervasive particles have become a global environmental concern.</p>
    <p>Recently, scientific research has confirmed the presence of microplastics not just in our environment (oceans, soil, air), but also within the human body. Studies have detected microplastic particles in various human tissues and fluids, including blood, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and even the placenta of unborn babies. This indicates that humans are constantly exposed to and absorbing these particles through ingestion (food, water) and inhalation (air).</p>
    <p>While the long-term health effects of microplastics inside the human body are still largely unknown and under intense investigation, scientists are concerned about their potential to cause inflammation, cell damage, and disrupt various bodily functions. The discovery underscores the urgent need for a better understanding of the human health impacts and for global efforts to reduce plastic pollution.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-explanation">
        <h3>1. Present Perfect Tense (e.g., "They've found", "I've read")</h3>
        <p>The present perfect tense is used to describe actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past or actions that started in the past and continue to the present. It often links a past event to its present relevance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form:</strong> <em>have/has + past participle</em></li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "They've found microplastics inside people." (The discovery happened in the past, but the fact of their presence is still true and relevant now.)</li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "I've read" (The reading happened in the past, and the information is current in Alice's mind.)</li>
            <li><strong>Why it's used:</strong> To talk about recent news or experiences that have an impact on the present conversation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 & 2)</h3>
        <p>Conditional sentences describe a condition and the result of that condition. They often use 'if'.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1 (Real Conditional):</strong> Used for possible situations in the present or future.
                <br><em>Form:</em> If + present simple, will + base verb
                <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "So, <strong>if I get a paper cut, will I bleed glitter?</strong>" (Bob is asking about a possible, albeit humorous, future consequence.)</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 (Unreal/Hypothetical Conditional):</strong> Used for imaginary or unlikely situations in the present or future.
                <br><em>Form:</em> If + past simple, would + base verb
                <br><em>Example (not directly in dialogue, but related concept):</em> "If I lived in a pristine bubble, I wouldn't worry about microplastics." (Implies he doesn't live in one.)
                <br><em>Example from dialogue (implied):</em> "Maybe I should start eating only things grown in a pristine, air-filtered bubble." (This is a suggestion for a hypothetical, unlikely action.)</li>
            <li><strong>Why they're used:</strong> To speculate, ask about potential outcomes, or suggest hypothetical solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Metaphors and Similes</h3>
        <p>These are figures of speech used to make descriptions more vivid and memorable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> A direct comparison between two unlike things, stating one *is* the other, without using "like" or "as."
                <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I'm basically a <strong>human plastic bag</strong> now?" (Directly comparing a person to a plastic bag.)
                <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "my <strong>inner Tupperware</strong>." (Directly comparing oneself to Tupperware.)</li>
            <li><strong>Simile:</strong> A comparison between two unlike things using "like" or "as."
                <br><em>Example (not in dialogue):</em> "The plastic bottle floated *like* a tiny boat."</li>
            <li><strong>Why they're used:</strong> To add humor, create vivid imagery, and simplify complex ideas by relating them to something familiar.</li>
        </ul>
