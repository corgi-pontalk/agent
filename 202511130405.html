    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, how was your weekend? Did you finally conquer that <span class="highlight-word">mountain</span>?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, Alice, you won't believe it! I tried, but the <span class="highlight-word">summit</span> felt miles away. My legs are still screaming!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Laughs) I told you to train! What happened? Did you get lost on the <span class="highlight-word">trail</span> again?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Not lost, exactly. More like... "exploring alternative <span class="highlight-word">paths</span>." And then I saw a tiny squirrel with a really big acorn and got distracted.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A squirrel? Bob, you went all that way to be captivated by a squirrel?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hey, it was a very determined squirrel! Anyway, the <span class="highlight-word">view</span> from the halfway point was amazing. You could see the whole <span class="highlight-word">valley</span>!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: That sounds nice. Did you make it to the <span class="highlight-word">forest</span> part? I hear it's really peaceful there.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Yes, the <span class="highlight-word">forest</span> was beautiful! But then I looked up and saw the <span class="highlight-word">cliff</span> face... and realized I probably needed more <span class="highlight-word">gear</span> than just my lunchbox.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Chuckles) No <span class="highlight-word">backpack</span>? No proper hiking boots? Bob, you're an adventure waiting to happen... in a very unprepared way.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: My old sneakers are fine! Mostly. I did slip once, almost rolled down to the next <span class="highlight-word">peak</span>. Good thing I grabbed a sturdy tree branch!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Be careful! So, no <span class="highlight-word">summit</span> for you this time, huh?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Not this time. My <span class="highlight-word">altitude sickness</span> was really just "tired legs" sickness. But next time, I'm getting proper <span class="highlight-word">climbing</span> lessons! And a bigger <span class="highlight-word">backpack</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good plan! Maybe we can go together next time. I know a great <span class="highlight-word">mountain range</span> not too far from here.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Really? With fewer determined squirrels, I hope? And maybe a flatter <span class="highlight-word">trail</span>?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Smiles) We'll see, Bob. We'll see. But it will definitely have a <span class="highlight-word">breathtaking</span> <span class="highlight-word">view</span>!</p>
