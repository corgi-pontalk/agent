Alice: Bob, are you still coming to the movie night on Friday?
Bob: Friday? Oh no, Alice, I thought it was Thursday! My brain's a calendar catastrophe.
Alice: A calendar catastrophe? It's literally written on the invite! Friday, 7 PM. You mixed up Tuesday and Wednesday last week too.
Bob: Did I? I swear I thought Tuesday was 'Taco Tuesday,' not 'Terrible Timetable Tuesday' for my meeting.
Alice: Exactly! And then you showed up for brunch on Sunday thinking it was Saturday.
Bob: Okay, *that* one was forgivable. All weekend days feel the same when you're relaxing!
Alice: Not when you're hungry! So, Friday for the movie. Got it?
Bob: Friday. F-R-I-D-A-Y. The day before Saturday, the day after Thursday. Yes, I think I'm getting there.
Alice: Good. Because if you miss it, you'll have to wait until next Monday for another chance to socialize with us.
Bob: Monday? Ugh, don't even say the M-word. Monday feels like the universe's way of telling us the fun is officially over.
Alice: Tell me about it. But then there's Tuesday, a bit better, and Wednesday, 'hump day' â€“ almost to the weekend!
Bob: And Thursday is just Friday's warm-up act. It's like, 'Almost there, but not quite!'
Alice: Haha, true. So, to recap: Friday movie, not Thursday. Don't show up on Wednesday.
Bob: Understood. My internal calendar has been temporarily recalibrated. I promise not to show up on a Sunday.
Alice: Excellent. See you then, Bob! And maybe check your phone's calendar once in a while.
