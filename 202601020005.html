    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Hey Bob, did you see that email about the 'Race Against Poverty' 5K next month?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! You mean the one where we'd have to, you know, <em>run</em>? My personal goal for poverty reduction is mostly focused on reducing my own poverty of snacks.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Hilarious, Bob. But seriously, it's <strong>for a good cause</strong>. They're aiming to raise awareness for the global poverty reduction goals.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Global poverty reduction goals, huh? That sounds like a heavy topic for a Tuesday morning. My goal for this morning was successfully extracting myself from bed. That was a challenge.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Well, one of the main goals is to end extreme poverty by 2030. It's a <strong>massive undertaking</strong>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> 2030? That's, like, tomorrow in global terms! We'd better <strong>get cracking</strong>. I suppose my snack reduction plan <em>could</em> free up some funds for a donation.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Every little bit helps! And it's not just about money. It's about access to education, healthcare, clean water... things we often <strong>take for granted</strong>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Access to education, you say? So if I finally learn how to properly fold a fitted sheet, I'm contributing? Because that feels like a monumental personal achievement.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> <em>(rolls her eyes playfully)</em> Very funny. But yes, empowering communities through education is crucial. Imagine the impact!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> I am imagining it. Me, finally mastering the fitted sheet, leading a global revolution of neatly folded linens. It's a noble dream.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> You're incorrigible. But on a serious note, the progress has actually been quite remarkable over the past few decades, even with all the current challenges.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> So, you're saying my refusal to run a 5K won't single-handedly undo years of progress? What a relief! My calves thank you.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Not quite, but it's a <strong>collective effort</strong>. Governments, NGOs, individuals... we all have a role.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Right, right. So, I'll start by reducing the poverty of knowledge about fitted sheets, and then maybe, just maybe, I'll consider that 5K. After a substantial pre-run snack.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Deal. Just promise me you'll actually <strong>read up on</strong> what the UN's Sustainable Development Goals entail.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Only if you promise to teach me the secret art of fitted sheet folding, Alice. It's for a good cause, you know. Global domestic harmony!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> <em>(laughs)</em> You're impossible!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Global efforts to reduce poverty have made significant strides, particularly in decreasing extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $2.15 a day (as of 2017 purchasing power parity). The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) aims to "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. While millions have been lifted out of poverty over the past decades, challenges persist. Factors like climate change, conflicts, economic shocks, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have complicated progress, and in some regions, poverty rates have even risen. Achieving the 2030 goal requires sustained international cooperation, robust economic growth, and targeted social protection programs, alongside increased investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, especially for vulnerable populations.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Conditional Sentences (Type 1)</h3>
        <p>Type 1 conditional sentences are used to talk about real and possible situations in the future. They describe a condition and its probable result.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> If + simple present, will + base form of verb.</li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "If I finally learn how to properly fold a fitted sheet, I'm contributing?" (<em>Slight variation, using present continuous for a current consequence.</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Clearer example:</strong> "If we join the race, we <strong>will raise</strong> money for charity."</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> The 'if' clause states the condition (joining the race), and the main clause states the likely result (raising money).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning, often idiomatic and different from the individual words.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong> <strong>read up on</strong>, <strong>free up</strong>, <strong>get cracking</strong>, <strong>take for granted</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Explanation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read up on:</strong> (verb + preposition) meaning to study or research a topic by reading.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free up:</strong> (verb + adverb) meaning to make something available or no longer busy/occupied.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get cracking:</strong> (verb + adverb) meaning to start doing something quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Take for granted:</strong> (verb + preposition + adverb) meaning to not appreciate something because you are so used to it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
