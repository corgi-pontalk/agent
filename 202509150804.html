        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, you won't believe the battle I just had with my Wi-Fi router. It's like it has a personal vendetta against my productivity!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, Alice, that's small potatoes. While you're wrestling with Wi-Fi, the real tech titans are duking it out in a quantum computing race!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Quantum what now? Are we talking about tiny, invisible computers that hate my internet connection even more?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Even tinier, even more invisible! And way more powerful. We're talking about the U.S. and China, neck and neck, trying to build machines that could make our current supercomputers look like abacuses.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Abacuses? That's a bit dramatic, isn't it? So, who's winning this microscopic arms race?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It's a bit of a seesaw. The U.S. has strong fundamental research and private companies like IBM and Google pushing boundaries. But China is investing heavily, pouring billions into research and talent, and has made some impressive breakthroughs.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Billions? For computers that might not even fit on my desk? What's the big deal, anyway? What can they *do*?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Imagine cracking codes that would take regular computers billions of years. Or developing new materials at an atomic level. Or drug discovery that's light-years ahead. It's a total game-changer, Alice.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. So, if China gets there first, does that mean they'll have all the super-secret information and cure all diseases before us?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Potentially! It's about strategic advantage, national security, and economic dominance. It’s like the space race, but for computations.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: And here I was, worried about buffering. So, are we talking about the U.S. trying to catch up, or are they still leading in some areas?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It's complex. The U.S. arguably has a slight lead in certain hardware and software aspects, but China is rapidly closing the gap, especially in areas like quantum communication and sensing. It's a sprint and a marathon at the same time.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, basically, while I'm troubleshooting my smart speaker, there's a global battle brewing over the future of… everything?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Precisely! Your smart speaker is a quaint relic compared to what's coming. One day, your Wi-Fi router might just *quantum-leap* over your current issues.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I'll believe that when I see it. For now, I just want my cat videos to load seamlessly. But okay, you've piqued my interest, Bob. Maybe I'll actually read an article about it.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: That's the spirit, Alice! Just be prepared for your mind to be slightly boggled.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The quantum computing race between the U.S. and China is a high-stakes competition with significant implications for national security, economic power, and technological advancement. Both nations are investing heavily in research and development, aiming to achieve "quantum supremacy" – the point where quantum computers can solve problems beyond the capability of classical supercomputers.</p>
        <p>The U.S. benefits from a strong ecosystem of private companies (e.g., IBM, Google, Microsoft), established universities, and government funding (e.g., the National Quantum Initiative). It holds an advantage in foundational research, chip design, and venture capital investment.</p>
        <p>China, through its national strategic initiatives and substantial government funding, has made rapid progress. It has established major quantum research centers, attracted top talent, and demonstrated breakthroughs in areas such as quantum communication (e.g., the Micius satellite) and quantum sensing. Its focus on practical applications and long-term national planning positions it as a formidable competitor.</p>
        <p>The race is characterized by intense competition in hardware (qubit development, error correction), software (algorithms), and applications. While the U.S. currently maintains a narrow lead in some key areas, China's accelerated investments and strategic focus are rapidly closing the gap, making the outcome a subject of ongoing observation and debate.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small potatoes</strong>: Something unimportant, especially when compared to something else.
                <span class="example-sentence">My small coding bug is <span class="answer">small potatoes</span> compared to the security breach the company just experienced.</span></li>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "It's been heating up")</strong>:
                Used to describe an action that started in the past and is still continuing in the present, or has recently stopped but has a clear connection to the present. It emphasizes the duration or ongoing nature of the action.
                <br><em>Structure:</em> Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing
                <br><em>Example:</em> "I've been studying English for two years." (The studying started two years ago and continues now.)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Modal Verbs for Speculation (e.g., "could revolutionize," "might be able to")</strong>:
                <code>Could</code>, <code>might</code>, and <code>may</code> are used to express possibility or uncertainty about a present or future action or state. <code>Could</code> often implies a general possibility, while <code>might</code> and <code>may</code> imply a slightly weaker or more specific possibility.
                <br><em>Example:</em> "It <span class="answer">could</span> rain later." (It's possible.) "She <span class="answer">might</span> come to the party." (It's a possibility, but not certain.)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Phrasal Verbs (e.g., "catch up," "close the gap")</strong>:
                Verbs combined with a preposition or adverb (or both) to create a new meaning that is often different from the original verb.
                <br><em>Example (catch up):</em> "He ran faster to <span class="answer">catch up</span> with his friends." (reach the same point)
                <br><em>Example (close the gap):</em> "The new policies aim to <span class="answer">close the gap</span> between rich and poor." (reduce the difference)
            </li>
        </ul>
