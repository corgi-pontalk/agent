Alice : Bob, guess what I did today? Bob : Alice, tell me! Did you finally start your own amazing... _cupcake empire_? Alice : Even better! I tried to help my uncle with his marketing for his new pet rock business. Bob : Pet rocks? Alice, are you serious? That's a challenging product! Alice : Exactly! He thinks everyone will be a customer. I told him we need a target audience. Maybe people who really miss their old pet rocks? Bob : Good point! So, what was your big marketing idea? Did you advertise on a tiny rock-sized billboard? Alice : Haha, not quite! I suggested a promotion. Buy one pet rock, get a free tiny leash! Bob : A leash for a rock? That's... unique. What about a brand name and a slogan? Alice : We're working on 'Rocky & Friends: Your Unbreakable Companion!' for the brand. And the slogan is 'Always there, never sheds!' Bob : Never sheds! I love it! That's a strong campaign right there. Alice : He even wants a logo. I suggested a happy rock with googly eyes. Bob : Perfect! You're a natural at this, Alice. Maybe we should open our own marketing agency for quirky products. Alice : Only if you handle the sales calls, Bob. My voice isn't ready for convincing people they need a rock. Bob : Deal! So, when do we launch the 'Buy 10, get 1 free' sale? Alice : Slow down, superstar! We need to analyze the market first. And maybe give the pet rocks tiny hats. Bob : Tiny hats... brilliant! This is going to be huge! Alice : Let's hope so. My uncle is counting on us to make his pet rocks famous!
