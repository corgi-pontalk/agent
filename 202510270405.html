        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, what are you doing this afternoon? I really need to go clothes shopping!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, shopping? Oh, no, not again! My wallet still has PTSD from your last trip.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Don't be silly! I just need a new top. And maybe some trousers. And possibly a jacketâ€¦</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: See? It always starts with "just one thing."</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: But I have nothing to wear! My closet is full, but nothing fits my <i>vibe</i> today.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Your <i>vibe</i>? Is that like when my shirt says "weekend" but my pants say "I still need to do laundry"?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! So, are you coming? I need a second opinion. A <i>stylish</i> second opinion.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Me? Stylish? My best fashion advice is "Is it clean?" and "Does it match my other clean clothes?"</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Come on! It'll be fun. We can get ice cream afterward.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ice cream? Okay, you got my attention. What kind of clothes are you looking for?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Something bright! Maybe a yellow dress? Or a floral skirt?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Yellow? Floral? My eyes! Are you trying to blind me in the fitting room?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Don't worry, I'll pick something nice for you too. A new t-shirt, perhaps?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, no, no, no. My t-shirts are perfectly fine. They have character. And maybe a few questionable stains.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Perfect! Let's go then. My "vibe" is calling for retail therapy!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (Sighs) Lead the way, fashionista. Just promise we won't buy <i>everything</i>.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Shopping for clothes is a common activity. People go to stores, markets, or shop online to buy new shirts, pants, dresses, and other items to wear. They might need clothes for a special event, for a new season (like winter or summer), or just to update their wardrobe and feel good.

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

        <h3>1. "Need to" + Verb</h3>
        <p>We use <b>"need to" + the base form of a verb</b> to say that something is important or necessary to do.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Structure:</b> Subject + need to + Base Verb</li>
            <li><b>Example from dialogue:</b> "I really <b>need to go</b> clothes shopping!"</li>
            <li><b>Other examples:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>I <b>need to buy</b> new shoes for work.</li>
                    <li>She <b>needs to study</b> for the test tomorrow.</li>
                    <li>Do you <b>need to leave</b> early?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Present Continuous for Future Plans</h3>
        <p>We use the <b>present continuous</b> (verb 'to be' + verb-ing) to talk about plans or arrangements for the near future. It's often used when the plan is already set or agreed upon.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Structure:</b> Subject + am/is/are + Verb-ing</li>
            <li><b>Example from dialogue:</b> "What <b>are you doing</b> this afternoon?"</li>
            <li><b>Other examples:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>We <b>are meeting</b> friends for dinner tonight.</li>
                    <li>He <b>is coming</b> to the party on Saturday.</li>
                    <li>Are they <b>going</b> to the beach tomorrow?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Question Words: What & How</h3>
        <p>We use question words to ask for specific information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What</b>: Used to ask about things, ideas, or actions.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Example from dialogue:</b> "<b>What</b> are you doing this afternoon?"</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> "<b>What</b> is your favorite color?"</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> "<b>What</b> kind of clothes are you looking for?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>How</b>: Used to ask about the manner or way something is done, or about quantity/quality. (Not directly in dialogue, but good for shopping context).
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> "<b>How</b> do I look in this dress?" (Asking about appearance/quality)</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> "<b>How</b> much does it cost?" (Asking about quantity/price)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
