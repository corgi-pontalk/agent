    <h2>Dialogue</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, remember that disastrous cake we tried to bake last month?<br>
        <strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Oh no, don't remind me! My kitchen still smells of burnt sugar and forgotten dreams.<br>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> We really needed to <em>work together</em> better, didn't we?<br>
        <strong>Bob:</strong> Definitely! I thought I was <em>pulling my weight</em> by just... supervising the flour.<br>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Supervising? Bob, you were supposed to mix! And you used a spoon when we needed a whisk!<br>
        <strong>Bob:</strong> Well, we weren't exactly <em>on the same page</em> about the recipe, were we? Some parts said 'mix', others said 'stir vigorously'... confusing!<br>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> You put salt instead of sugar! How can two people be so completely <em>out of sync</em>?<br>
        <strong>Bob:</strong> Hey, it was a "team effort" to misunderstand the instructions, I tell you! A glorious, salty-sweet mess!<br>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> More like a 'team disaster'! Next time, we should <em>divide the tasks</em> clearly.<br>
        <strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, okay. Next time, I'll be the 'chief taste-tester'. You handle everything else, from measuring to decorating.<br>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> That's not teamwork, Bob! Teamwork means <em>everyone contributes</em> equally to the actual work!<br>
        <strong>Bob:</strong> Fine, fine. Maybe we need to <em>brainstorm</em> our roles better before we start. Like, a pre-baking strategy meeting.<br>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! Or just order a cake. Much safer for everyone involved.<br>
        <strong>Bob:</strong> But where's the fun in that? We need to <em>learn to collaborate</em> and make our <em>own</em> delicious (or at least edible) cake!<br>
        <strong>Alice:</strong> Right. But maybe with oven mitts and a fire extinguisher on standby next time.

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>

    <p>
        Teamwork is a very important part of life! Whether you are at school, at work, or even just planning a party with friends, you often need to work with other people. Knowing how to talk about teamwork helps you communicate better and understand what others mean when discussing group projects. These expressions help you explain if a team is doing well, or if they need to improve how they work together. Learning them will make you a better team player and a more confident English speaker!

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>"Need to" and "Should" for expressing necessity or advice:</strong>
            <p>
                We use <strong>"need to"</strong> when something is necessary or required.
                <br><em>Example:</em> "We <strong>need to</strong> work together." (It's necessary for us to work together.)
            </p>
            <p>
                We use <strong>"should"</strong> when giving advice or suggesting something is a good idea.
                <br><em>Example:</em> "We <strong>should</strong> divide the tasks." (It's a good idea to divide the tasks.)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Phrasal Verbs and Idioms:</strong>
            <p>
                Many of the teamwork expressions are phrasal verbs or idioms. These are groups of words that have a meaning different from the individual words.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For example: <strong>"Work together"</strong>. "Work" is a verb, "together" is an adverb, but they combine to mean "cooperate".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another example: <strong>"Pull your weight"</strong>. This doesn't literally mean to pull something heavy. It means to do your fair share of work.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's important for beginners to learn these phrases as whole units, as their meaning isn't always obvious from the individual words.
            </p>
