    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Hey Bob, what's got you so buzzed this morning? Did you win the lottery?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! Even better! I just read that the EU enlargement plans are really gaining traction! Imagine, more countries joining the club!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, really? Another country joining the club? I thought the waiting list was longer than my grocery list on a Sunday afternoon. What's "on the cards" this time?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Well, they're talking about bringing in several new members, like the Western Balkans and even Ukraine and Moldova! It's a huge shift!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Ukraine and Moldova? Wow. Bigger usually means more bureaucracy, Bob. Are we ready for more paperwork, more translations, and more debates about agricultural subsidies?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Come on, Alice, think of the possibilities! More cultural exchange, a stronger geopolitical bloc, maybe even cheaper phone roaming across more countries!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Cheaper roaming *is* a strong argument, I'll give you that. But what about the economic impact? And the inevitable "red tape" involved in integrating new economies?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> They'll figure it out! It's all about political will, isn't it? The vision is a larger, more unified Europe! Think of the new markets!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> New markets, or just more people for existing members to subsidize? I'm just hoping they sort out the existing issues first before expanding the pie.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> You're such a pragmatist! But they say it's about sharing prosperity and increasing stability. Plus, new holiday destinations without pesky border controls!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> You're just thinking about your next vacation, aren't you? What about the actual challenges, like corruption in candidate countries or integrating vastly different legal systems?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Details, details! The general sentiment is that it's high time. After years of discussion, it seems like real progress is *on the cards* now, largely due to recent geopolitical events.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> *On the cards*, eh? Well, let's hope it's not just another really long committee meeting that accomplishes nothing. I'd like to see actual reforms.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Always the realist, Alice! But a bit of optimism never hurt anyone, especially when we're talking about expanding the world's largest single market!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Fair enough, Bob. Just make sure you read the fine print before you start packing your bags for the newest member state. I hear the accession process is quite a journey.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The European Union's enlargement plans have received renewed impetus in recent years, particularly following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This event highlighted the strategic importance of integrating neighboring countries into the EU bloc to foster stability, democracy, and economic prosperity.</p>
    <p>Currently, several countries hold candidate status, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Western Balkans:</strong> Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo (which has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement). These countries have been on a path toward EU membership for many years, with varying degrees of progress in implementing necessary reforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Eastern Europe:</strong> Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. Ukraine and Moldova were granted candidate status in 2022, and Georgia followed in December 2023, reflecting a geopolitical shift and a strong signal of support from the EU.</li>
        <li><strong>Turkey:</strong> While formally a candidate country, accession negotiations with Turkey have been effectively frozen due to concerns over human rights and rule of law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The enlargement process is complex, requiring candidate countries to adopt and implement a vast body of EU law (the "acquis communautaire") across numerous policy areas. This often necessitates significant reforms in areas such as democracy, rule of law, human rights, market economy, and administrative capacity. For the EU, enlargement requires careful consideration of its own institutional capacity and budget, and decisions on accession require unanimous agreement from all existing member states.</p>
    <p>The renewed focus indicates a strategic shift within the EU, recognizing enlargement as a tool for geopolitical influence and long-term security, rather than solely a technical process.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Future Tenses (Will vs. Going To)</h3>
    <p>Both "will" and "going to" are used to talk about the future, but they often imply different nuances.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Will:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spontaneous decisions:</strong> Decisions made at the moment of speaking.
                    <ul><li>Example: "Don't worry about the paperwork, I <span class="key-phrase">will</span> help you figure it out." (Alice's implied offer)</li></ul></li>
                <li><strong>Predictions (general):</strong> Often based on opinion or expectation, without strong evidence.
                    <ul><li>Example: "I think the EU <span class="key-phrase">will</span> definitely expand in the next decade." (Bob's general optimism)</li></ul></li>
                <li><strong>Promises and offers:</strong>
                    <ul><li>Example: "I <span class="key-phrase">will</span> call you tomorrow."</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Going To:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plans and intentions:</strong> Decisions made before the moment of speaking; something you intend to do.
                    <ul><li>Example: "I <span class="key-phrase">am going to</span> visit France next summer."</li></ul></li>
                <li><strong>Predictions (based on evidence):</strong> Predictions based on something you can see or know now.
                    <ul><li>Example: "Look at those dark clouds! It's <span class="key-phrase">going to</span> rain." (Not explicitly in dialogue, but relevant).</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the dialogue, Bob uses "They'll figure it out!" which is a spontaneous prediction or assumption about future problem-solving.</p>

    <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning. They are very common in spoken English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Figure out:</span> To understand or solve something.
            <ul><li>Example from dialogue: "They'll <span class="key-phrase">figure it out</span>!"</li></ul></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Sort out:</span> To resolve a problem or organize something.
            <ul><li>Example from dialogue: "I'm just hoping they <span class="key-phrase">sort out</span> the existing issues first..."</li></ul></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Chip in:</span> To contribute money or help (often informally).
            <ul><li>Example: "If everyone <span class="key-phrase">chips in</span>, we can buy a great present." (Not explicitly in dialogue but related to "sharing the burden" or "sharing prosperity")</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
