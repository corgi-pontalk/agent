Alice: Hey Bob, what are you doing this Saturday?
Bob: Hi Alice! Oh, I was thinking of finally washing my car. Why?
Alice: Well, I was hoping we could go for a picnic. It's supposed to be lovely.
Bob: A picnic? Hmm, let me check... my weather app says 'partly cloudy'.
Alice: Partly cloudy is fine! Perfect for a picnic. Not too hot.
Bob: True. But wait, five minutes ago it said 'sunny'. And now it's updated to 'chance of rain' for the afternoon.
Alice: Rain? Oh no! But it was so bright this morning. Was it sunny where you are?
Bob: Yeah, super sunny! But the app is now showing 'windy' with 'light showers' by 3 PM.
Alice: Light showers? So, just a little bit wet? We could bring an umbrella!
Bob: Or a boat! My app just changed to 'heavy rain' and 'thunderstorms' warnings for the evening. It's like the weather can't make up its mind!
Alice: Thunderstorms? Bob, are you sure your app isn't predicting the end of the world? It looked so calm, not even 'foggy' this morning!
Bob: It's usually very accurate! But today, it's wild. It just said 'cold front approaching', then 'scattered snow flurries' for Sunday!
Alice: Snow flurries? Bob, it's June! I think your app is broken. Are you sure it's not 'blizzard' next?
Bob: Don't tempt fate! But seriously, maybe we should just stay inside. What about 'movie night' instead? My app says it will be 'stormy' all weekend anyway.
Alice: Movie night it is! Much safer than battling a 'blizzard' in June. Thanks for the... _detailed_ weather report, Bob!
Bob: Anytime, Alice! I just saved us from a potential 'hailstorm' too, probably!
