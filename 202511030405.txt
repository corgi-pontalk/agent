Alice: Bob, are we going the right way? This street looks new to me.
Bob: Alice, don't worry! My Google Maps is *always* right. See? It says "continue straight for 200 meters."
Alice: But the sign right there says "Dead End."
Bob: Ah, that's just a suggestion, Alice. Google knows better. Let's go!
Alice: (Sighs) Okay, Mr. Google Maps Expert. But if we end up in a pond, it's on you.
Bob: (A moment later) Hmm, it says "You have arrived at your destination." But... this is a park bench.
Alice: A park bench? Bob, we're supposed to be at "Pizza Paradise"! Is this a new eco-friendly branch?
Bob: Uh, maybe Google Maps is testing my detective skills. It says "Pizza Paradise is 100 meters *to your left*."
Alice: Your left or *my* left? Because your left is usually my right.
Bob: (Checks phone) Oh, it means *my* left, which is *your* right. Wait, no. My left is my left!
Alice: Just point!
Bob: Okay, it's that way! (Points in a completely different direction than before)
Alice: Bob, are you sure you typed in "Pizza Paradise" and not "Park Bench Paradise"?
Bob: (Eyes widen) Uh oh. My phone autocorrected it to "Pajama Paradise." That's a clothing store!
Alice: (Buries face in hands) Bob, please just give me the phone. I'll type it in this time.
