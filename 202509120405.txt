Alice: Hey Bob! You look… colorful today.
Bob: Oh, hi Alice! Thanks! I thought this Hawaiian shirt was perfect for the rain. It brings the sun!
Alice: The rain? Bob, it's sunny outside. And it's November.
Bob: Is it? Oh. Well, it's still good for making people smile! Look at these pink flamingos!
Alice: They are… very visible. Are you going to a party?
Bob: No, just to the supermarket. I need some milk.
Alice: You're going to buy milk in _that_ shirt? And those bright green shorts?
Bob: Of course! Comfort is key. Plus, these shorts are new. My old jeans ripped yesterday.
Alice: Ripped? Oh no! Was it a big rip?
Bob: Well, let's just say my cat thinks I needed more "ventilation" in the back.
Alice: Your _cat_ ripped your jeans? How?
Bob: He got stuck when I was trying to put them on. Long story. So, new shorts it is!
Alice: Maybe next time, buy pants _without_ cat assistance. And maybe something in a darker color for the supermarket?
Bob: Nonsense! This is my "happy shopping" outfit! Want to come? You can wear something bright too!
Alice: No thanks, Bob. I think I'll stick to my plain t-shirt and jeans today. Someone has to look normal.
