Alice: Oh, hey Bob! What’s wrong? You look like you just saw a ghost.
Bob: Alice! My life is falling apart! I can't find my pen!
Alice: Your pen? Did you check your pockets? Or maybe it’s in your bag?
Bob: My bag! Right! (He rummages) Hmm, no pen. Just a half-eaten banana and a receipt from 2021.
Alice: A receipt from 2021? Bob, your bag is a time capsule! Do you even use that bag?
Bob: Of course! It holds all my… important things. Like this banana. Wait, is this my phone ringing?
Alice: I think so! It sounds like it’s coming from… under your arm?
Bob: (He checks) Oh! It was in my hand! I was holding it the whole time! I thought it was my wallet.
Alice: (Laughs) You thought your phone was your wallet? Are you sure you had enough coffee this morning?
Bob: Maybe I need more. Now, where was my pen? I really need to write something down.
Alice: Here, you can borrow mine. (She pulls a pen from her small bag) See? Easy. My bag is much more organized.
Bob: Wow, a magic bag! Mine just eats things. Like my pen. And probably that banana by now.
Alice: Don't worry, Bob. We'll find your pen eventually. Or buy a new one. Or maybe a new bag!
Bob: A new bag might be a good idea. One that doesn't hide my phone in plain sight.
Alice: Sounds like a plan! Now, about that receipt...
