    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what? I just tried to order 'Worcestershire sauce' and nearly dislocated my tongue!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you again? I still remember you asking for 'ex-presso' instead of 'espresso'!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (exaggerated gasp) That was <em>one time</em>! And how was I supposed to know 'X' isn't always 'ex'?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, the alphabet is a good start. 'X' can be tricky, true. Like 'xylophone' starts with a 'Z' sound.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: See! It's a conspiracy! Who decided 'C' could be 'K' or 'S'? And 'G' could be 'guh' or 'juh'?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: English is like a box of chocolates, Alice. You never know what sound you're gonna get.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: More like a box of alphabet soup that's been dropped on the floor and randomly reassembled!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (chuckles) Okay, you have a point. But <span class="key-phrase">practice makes perfect</span>. Let's try 'A' for 'apple'.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: <span class="key-phrase">Easy peasy</span>. 'A' for 'aardvark'. Now, 'B' for 'bizarre' pronunciation rules.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Very funny. How about 'C' for 'cat' and 'cinema'? Notice the difference?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I do! It's <span class="key-phrase">maddening</span>. 'Cat' is 'K' sound, 'cinema' is 'S' sound. Why, English, why?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It's the wild west of linguistics, my friend. But mastering the alphabet sounds is step one.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, 'W' for 'whyyyyy' is not helpful?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Definitely not. But 'W' for 'wonderful' progress, yes! <span class="key-phrase">That's the spirit</span>!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Alright, 'W' for 'whiskey' – wait, no. 'W' for 'we'll get there eventually'!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The English alphabet has 26 letters, but these letters don't always correspond to a single sound. Many letters have multiple pronunciations depending on their position in a word or the letters around them. This can be a major challenge for English learners, as knowing how to spell a word doesn't automatically tell you how to pronounce it. Words like 'read' (present) and 'read' (past), or 'through', 'tough', 'thought', and 'thorough' demonstrate how inconsistent English pronunciation can be. Mastering the basic sounds of the alphabet and recognizing common sound patterns is crucial for both speaking clearly and understanding spoken English.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Dislocated my tongue</span>: A humorous exaggeration meaning something was extremely difficult to pronounce.
            <p class="example-sentence">That German word was so long, I nearly <span class="key-phrase">dislocated my tongue</span> trying to say it!</p></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Practice makes perfect</span>: A common idiom meaning that repeating an activity will lead to improvement.
            <p class="example-sentence">Don't worry if your pronunciation isn't perfect yet; <span class="key-phrase">practice makes perfect</span>.</p></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Easy peasy</span>: An informal phrase meaning very easy.
            <p class="example-sentence">Once you learn the rules, saying these words becomes <span class="key-phrase">easy peasy</span>.</p></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">Maddening</span>: Causing great annoyance; frustrating.
            <p class="example-sentence">The inconsistent spelling rules can be truly <span class="key-phrase">maddening</span> for new learners.</p></li>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">That's the spirit!</span>: An expression of encouragement, used to praise someone's positive attitude.
            <p class="example-sentence">"I'm going to keep trying!" – "<span class="key-phrase">That's the spirit</span>!"</p></li>
    </ul>
