    <h1 class="section-title">Dialogue</h1>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, you won't believe how annoyed I am right now. My phone just died mid-selfie, again!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, classic Alice! But seriously, I was just reading an article about advances in battery technology. Apparently, our charging woes might soon be a thing of the past.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A thing of the past? You mean I won't have to carry a power bank bigger than my actual phone?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! They're talking about solid-state batteries, which could charge electric cars in minutes, not hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Minutes? That's insane! Imagine plugging in your car during a coffee break and it's fully charged. No more range anxiety!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Right? And it's not just cars. Think about your laptop lasting a week on a single charge.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A week? My laptop barely makes it through a long Netflix session without begging for a charger. This sounds like science fiction.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It's getting pretty close to reality. Plus, these new batteries are often safer and more environmentally friendly.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Safer and greener? Now you're really speaking my language. No more worrying about my phone turning into a small, exploding hand warmer.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hopefully! They're also making them smaller and lighter, which means even sleeker devices.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: So, theoretically, my next phone could be paper-thin and last a month? I might actually remember to charge it then!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, maybe not a month for a phone right away, but the potential is huge. Imagine smartwatches that you never have to take off to charge.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: That would be revolutionary! No more 'low battery' alerts ruining my gym workout data. Are these innovations already out there?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Some are in early stages, some are prototypes, but the progress is definitely accelerating. We're on the cusp of some major changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good, because my current battery life is living in the Stone Age. I'm ready for the future, Bob! Bring on the eternal power!</p>

    <h1 class="section-title">Current Situation</h1>

    <p>Battery technology is experiencing a rapid evolution, moving beyond the traditional lithium-ion cells that power most of our current devices. Researchers and manufacturers are focused on increasing energy density (how much power a battery can store), improving charging speed, enhancing safety, and reducing environmental impact.</p>

    <p>Key advancements include solid-state batteries, which use solid electrodes and electrolytes instead of liquid ones. These promise higher energy density, faster charging times, and significantly reduced risks of fire compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. While still largely in the research and development phase for mass production, prototypes are showing impressive results, particularly for electric vehicles (EVs) where they could enable hundreds of miles of range with just minutes of charging.</p>

    <p>Beyond solid-state, there's also significant work on alternative chemistries like sodium-ion batteries, which use more abundant and cheaper materials, and flow batteries for large-scale grid storage. Fast-charging innovations are also crucial, allowing devices and vehicles to power up in a fraction of the time. These advancements are set to revolutionize everything from smartphones and wearable tech to electric cars and renewable energy storage, leading to more convenient, powerful, and sustainable solutions for our energy needs.</p>

    <h1 class="section-title">Grammar Points</h1>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Modals for Possibility: "Might" and "Could"</h3>
        <p>We use "might" and "could" to express possibility or probability about the present or future. "Could" can sometimes imply a slightly higher degree of possibility or capability than "might," but they are often interchangeable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Might</strong>: "Our charging woes <strong>might</strong> soon be a thing of the past." (It is possible that they will be.)</li>
            <li><strong>Could</strong>: "Solid-state batteries <strong>could</strong> charge electric cars in minutes." (It is possible that they will, and they have the capability.)</li>
            <li><strong>Could</strong>: "My next phone <strong>could</strong> be paper-thin." (It is a possibility.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Present Perfect for Recent Events</h3>
        <p>The Present Perfect tense is used to talk about actions or states that happened at an unspecified time before now, or that started in the past and continue to the present. It's often used when the action has a clear connection to the present.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"My phone just died mid-selfie, again!" (The action of dying happened recently and has an immediate effect â€“ annoyance.)</li>
            <li>"Progress <strong>has been accelerating</strong>." (The acceleration started in the past and continues to now.)</li>
            <li>"Battery technology <strong>has experienced</strong> a rapid evolution." (The evolution happened and its results are still present.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Gerunds as Subjects or Objects</h3>
        <p>A gerund is a verb form ending in "-ing" that functions as a noun. It can be the subject of a sentence, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject</strong>: "<strong>Carrying</strong> a power bank is annoying." (What is annoying? Carrying a power bank.)</li>
            <li><strong>Object of verb</strong>: "I enjoy <strong>reading</strong> about new technology." (What do I enjoy? Reading.)</li>
            <li><strong>Object of preposition</strong>: "No more <strong>worrying</strong> about my phone." (Worrying is the object of the preposition "about.")</li>
