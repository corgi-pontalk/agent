Bob : Alice, can you help me with something? It's really important! Alice : Bob! Oh, okay. What do you need? Is it heavy? Because my "heavy lifting" fee is quite high today. Bob : Haha, very funny. It's just moving some boxes in my apartment. But one of them is HUGE. Like, really, really huge. Alice : Hmm, "really, really huge," you say? What's in it for me? Free lunch? Bob : Lunch? Uh, I was thinking... a heartfelt thank you? Alice : A heartfelt thank you won't feed me, Bob. My stomach negotiates hard. Bob : Okay, okay! How about coffee and a donut? My treat, after the boxes are moved. Alice : Coffee and a donut... for the HUGE box? That's a strong "no way!" from my muscles. Bob : Ugh, fine! How about coffee, a donut, AND I'll wash your car next weekend? Alice : Ooh, washing my car? Now you're talking! Does "next weekend" mean "definitely by Sunday evening"? Bob : Yes, definitely by Sunday evening! Deal? Alice : Let me think... okay, that sounds fair. But I choose the donut flavor! Bob : Deal! You can choose any donut flavor. Even the sprinkles one. Alice : Excellent! See, Bob? Everyone's a negotiator when they try hard enough. Bob : You're tough, Alice. Really tough. Remind me never to buy a car from you!
