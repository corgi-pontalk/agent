    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Hey Bob, long time no see! Are you still <b>working from home</b> these days?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice! Hey! Yeah, mostly. My couch has practically become my new office chair. It's a real <b>work from home</b> paradise... sometimes.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Haha, I can imagine! So, how are all the <b>virtual meetings</b> going? Any funny "you're on mute!" moments?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Oh, absolutely! Just yesterday, my cat walked across the keyboard during a big <b>video call</b> with the boss. Everyone saw its fluffy tail!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: (Laughing) Classic! At least you don't have to deal with the morning <b>commute</b> anymore, right? That's a huge win.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: You got that right! My <b>commute</b> is now from my bed to the coffee machine. Sometimes I even skip changing out of my pajamas!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: (Chuckles) Naughty! But seriously, do you like the <b>flexitime</b> aspect of it?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Definitely! I can work early, take a long lunch, then finish later. It’s great for going to the gym when it's not crowded.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: That sounds amazing. My friend became a <b>digital nomad</b> last year. She’s working from Bali right now!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Wow, a <b>digital nomad</b>! That's the dream. My "office" view is currently my neighbor's fence.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Maybe you should try a <b>coworking space</b> sometimes? To get out of the house.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: I tried one last month. It was nice, but I missed the freedom to wear silly hats during <b>video calls</b>. And my fridge is closer at home!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, you're impossible!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: It's called optimizing my <b>WFH experience</b>, Alice! My brain works best in comfort.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Well, as long as you're productive! Maybe next time we can do a <b>virtual coffee chat</b>?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Sounds great, Alice! From my couch to yours. I'll even put on a clean hat for the occasion!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: (Smiling) Don't you dare! See you then!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>
        Remote work, also known as <b>working from home (WFH)</b>, has become a very common way for people to do their jobs.
        Many companies started offering remote work options more frequently after recent global events, and now it's a popular choice for many employees.
        It means you can work from your house, a cafe, or even a different country if you're a <b>digital nomad</b>.
        People often use <b>virtual meetings</b> and <b>video calls</b> to connect with colleagues and clients.
        Some benefits include no daily <b>commute</b> and more <b>flexitime</b>, which allows for a flexible schedule. However, it can also be challenging to separate work and home life.
