    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, is it just me, or does the air outside feel... extra crispy today?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! You noticed too? I thought my toast was on fire, but then I realized it was just Tuesday.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Seriously though, the smell of smoke is getting intense. Is this another 'Global Wildfire Season' starting already?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Another one? Bob, I think we're just perpetually *in* one now. It's like an annual subscription we never asked for.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right? It feels earlier this year. Didn't we just pack away the air purifiers from last season?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I saw on the news, parts of Europe are already battling blazes, and North America isn't far behind. It's like the whole planet decided to host a bonfire party without inviting us.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: My allergies are having a field day, or rather, a 'field on fire' day. My eyes are watering like I'm watching a really sad documentary about the climate.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It's the new normal, isn't it? Used to be we'd worry about rain on our parade; now it's 'will our parade be visible through the smoke?'</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I'm starting to think weather reports should include a 'smoke index' alongside the UV. 'High chance of existential dread with a side of ash, folks!'</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Tell me about it. I was planning a hiking trip, but I guess 'scenic views' now mean 'orange skies and blurred horizons'.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Maybe we should invest in designer respirators? Make it a fashion statement. 'This season's hottest accessory: the N95 couture mask.'</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It's funny, but it's also terrifying. The scale of these wildfires is just insane.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Absolutely. I saw a graphic comparing the burned area to small countries. It's like Earth is playing a giant game of 'the floor is lava' and losing.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: We really need some serious action on climate change, or 2026 will just be 'Wildfire Season: The Sequel, with bigger explosions'.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Let's just hope the sequel comes with less smoke inhalation and more rain. And maybe some actual good news for once!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Here's hoping, Bob. In the meantime, pass the air purifier remote.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The "Global Wildfire Season 2025" is a hypothetical, yet increasingly realistic, scenario reflecting a worldwide trend of more frequent, intense, and prolonged wildfire events. Driven largely by climate change, rising global temperatures lead to drier conditions, prolonged droughts, and more extreme heatwaves, creating ideal conditions for fires to ignite and spread rapidly. Regions like the Mediterranean, parts of North and South America, Australia, and even areas not traditionally prone to large fires are experiencing earlier starts and extended periods of wildfire activity. These fires not only devastate ecosystems and wildlife but also severely impact air quality, human health, infrastructure, and local economies, making "wildfire season" feel like a perpetual state for many.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-phrase">extra crispy</span>: Describes something that is very dry, perhaps to the point of being brittle or scorched. In the dialogue, it humorously refers to dry, smoky air.

    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p><span class="grammar-point">"Is it just me, or...?" (Idiomatic Expression)</span></p>
            <p>This phrase is used to ask if your observation or feeling is shared by others, implying you suspect it might not be unique but want confirmation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Structure:</b> Is it just me, or + [your observation/feeling]?</li>
                <li><b>Example from Dialogue:</b> "Bob, <span class="grammar-point">is it just me, or</span> does the air outside feel... extra crispy today?"</li>
                <li><b>Another Example:</b> <span class="grammar-point">Is it just me, or</span> is this coffee stronger than usual?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="grammar-point">Present Continuous with "always," "perpetually," "constantly"</span></p>
            <p>While the present continuous usually describes actions happening now, when combined with adverbs like "always," "perpetually," or "constantly," it expresses an action that occurs repeatedly, often to show annoyance, surprise, or a sense of inevitability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Structure:</b> Subject + is/am/are + adverb (always/perpetually/constantly) + -ing verb</li>
                <li><b>Example from Dialogue:</b> "I think we're just <span class="grammar-point">perpetually in</span> one now." (Meaning: we are always experiencing a wildfire season.)</li>
                <li><b>Another Example:</b> He's <span class="grammar-point">always complaining</span> about the weather. (Expresses annoyance)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><span class="grammar-point">Similes</span></p>
            <p>A simile is a figure of speech that directly compares two different things using the words "like" or "as" to make the description more vivid. It often creates imagery or humor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Structure:</b> Thing A is like/as Thing B.</li>
                <li><b>Example from Dialogue:</b> "My eyes are watering <span class="grammar-point">like I'm watching a really sad documentary</span> about the climate." (Compares watering eyes to crying while watching a sad film.)</li>
                <li><b>Another Example:</b> The fighter was <span class="grammar-point">as brave as a lion</span>. (Compares the fighter's bravery to a lion's courage.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
