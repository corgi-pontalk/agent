laugh and learn! ## Dialogue
Alice: Bob, guess what I learned today! It's so galactic!
Bob: Galactic, Alice? Are you talking about space again?
Alice: Yes! I saw a documentary. It was about... *big rocks* flying around.
Bob: You mean planets? Or asteroids?
Alice: Yes! Planets! And how gravity pulls everything. Like, if I drop my sandwich... *plonk*!
Bob: Exactly! Gravity is why your sandwich doesn't float away. Good job, Alice.
Alice: And there are tiny things, like super tiny! Molecules! In everything! Even in this sandwich!
Bob: That's right. Everything is made of molecules , and even smaller, atoms.
Alice: Atoms! Are those the ones with little *sparks* inside?
Bob: You're thinking of electrons moving around the nucleus. Close enough for now!
Alice: And scientists! They do experiments to find new things. Like, what if I experiment with putting ketchup on my apple?
Bob: Please don't, Alice. Some experiments are best left to the professionals.
Alice: But it's for science! The science of taste!
Bob: Okay, okay, you're enthusiastic! Did you learn about dinosaurs too?
Alice: Dinosaurs! They were like giant *lizards* from a long time ago. So cool!
Bob: They certainly were. You're becoming a little scientist , Alice!
Alice: Maybe! But first, more sandwiches! My energy levels are low!
Bob: (chuckles) Sounds like a very important scientific observation.
