    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, guess what I saw today?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! Don't tell me you finally found a sustainable way to avoid laundry. My dryer is already feeling threatened.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Even better! I walked past that new 'Leafy Lofts' building downtown. It's supposed to be super sustainable.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Leafy Lofts? Is that the one that looks like a giant tree house for grown-ups?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! With solar panels on the roof and what looked like a vertical garden on every floor.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Ah, yes! I heard they collect rainwater for flushing toilets. Imagine that, flushing with yesterday's cloud!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: It's brilliant! Every drop counts. And the natural ventilation system means they barely use air conditioning.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, no more arctic office spaces in summer? My sweaters will be very disappointed.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Right? It's all about reducing their carbon footprint. Plus, the building materials are all locally sourced.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Locally sourced? So they didn't fly in marble from Italy? My dream of a Roman bath office is shattered.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Come on, Bob! It's much more eco-friendly. Less transportation, less emissions.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I know, I know. I'm just picturing a future where my house is built entirely from recycled coffee cups and old newspapers.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, some buildings are actually using recycled materials in innovative ways! Think 'upcycling' on a grand scale.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, my old socks could become insulation? Suddenly my sock drawer feels much more important.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe not socks, but definitely things like reclaimed wood and recycled concrete. It's truly inspiring.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: You're right, Alice. It's pretty cool. As long as my future sustainable home doesn't require me to water the walls daily.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Sustainable architecture, also known as green building, is a growing global movement focused on designing and constructing buildings with minimal environmental impact. The goal is to reduce the overall negative effects of the built environment on human health and the natural environment. This includes efficient use of energy, water, and other resources, protection of occupant health and productivity, and reduction of waste, pollution, and environmental degradation.</p>
    <p>Key features of sustainable architecture often include the use of renewable energy sources like solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems for non-potable uses, natural ventilation to reduce reliance on air conditioning, and green roofs or vertical gardens to improve insulation and biodiversity. There's also a strong emphasis on using locally sourced, recycled, or rapidly renewable building materials to minimize the carbon footprint associated with transportation and production. The ultimate aim for many projects is to achieve "net-zero" status, where a building produces as much energy as it consumes annually.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sustainable architecture</strong>: Design and construction practices that reduce environmental impact.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"</em><strong>Sustainable architecture</strong> <em>is becoming a priority for new urban developments."</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Carbon footprint</strong>: The total amount of greenhouse gases generated by our actions.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"Companies are actively working to reduce their</em> <strong>carbon footprint</strong> <em>by adopting eco-friendly practices."</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Vertical garden</strong>: A garden grown vertically on a wall, often for aesthetic and environmental benefits.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"The new office building features an impressive</em> <strong>vertical garden</strong> <em>that helps cool the interior."</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rainwater harvesting</strong>: The collection and storage of rainwater for reuse.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"Our home uses a</em> <strong>rainwater harvesting</strong> <em>system to water the plants."</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Locally sourced materials</strong>: Materials obtained from nearby regions to reduce transportation impact.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"Using</em> <strong>locally sourced materials</strong> <em>significantly lowers the project's environmental impact."</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Energy efficiency</strong>: Using less energy to achieve the same or better results.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"</em><strong>Energy efficiency</strong> <em>is crucial for reducing utility bills and protecting the environment."</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Upcycling</strong>: Reusing discarded objects or material in such a way as to create a product of higher quality or value than the original.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"She loves to</em> <strong>upcycle</strong> <em>old furniture into unique home decor pieces."</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Net-zero building</strong>: A building that produces as much energy as it consumes on an annual basis.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>"The city's new library is designed to be a</em> <strong>net-zero building</strong><em>, generating its own power."</em></p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Present Simple Tense</strong>: Used to express general truths, facts, habits, and ongoing actions relevant to the topic of sustainable architecture.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example 1: "It <strong>collects</strong> rainwater for flushing toilets." (A fact about the building)</em></p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example 2: "Sustainable architecture <strong>aims</strong> to minimize environmental harm." (A general truth)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Passive Voice</strong>: Often used when the action is more important than the doer, or when the doer is unknown or obvious. It's common when describing features or construction methods of buildings.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example 1: "It's <strong>supposed to be</strong> super sustainable." (Emphasis on the building's characteristic)</em></p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example 2: "The building materials <strong>are all locally sourced</strong>." (Emphasis on the materials, not who sourced them)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Modal Verbs (can, could, will, should)</strong>: Used to express possibility, ability, prediction, or advice.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example 1 (Possibility/Ability): "My old socks <strong>could become</strong> insulation?"</em></p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example 2 (Prediction): "My sweaters <strong>will be</strong> very disappointed."</em></p>
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example 3 (Advice/Necessity - not explicit in dialogue but useful for discussion): "We <strong>should</strong> consider more eco-friendly building practices."</em></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
