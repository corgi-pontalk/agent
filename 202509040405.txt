Alice: Bob, what's that huge box you're carrying? Are you moving house again?  
Bob: Oh, hi Alice! Nope, not moving. This is for my new, incredibly serious hobby!  
Alice: Incredibly serious? What hobby requires a box that big? It looks heavy!  
Bob: It's for competitive marshmallow stacking. High-stakes stuff, you know.  
Alice: Marshmallow stacking? Seriously? Where do you even do something like that?  
Bob: There's a secret society! Just kidding, it's a club. They meet downtown, near the old bookstore.  
Alice: Downtown? When does this… marshmallow club meet? I have to see this.  
Bob: Every Tuesday evening, precisely at 7 PM. Punctuality is key for perfect marshmallow towers.  
Alice: 7 PM? What do you actually *do* there? Just stack sticky sweets?  
Bob: We strategize, we balance, we overcome gravity! The person with the tallest stable stack wins.  
Alice: And what do you win? A lifetime supply of marshmallows?  
Bob: Almost! Bragging rights, a fancy certificate, and sometimes... a giant, novelty marshmallow.  
Alice: Haha! That sounds… unexpectedly fascinating. Where's the next big competition?  
Bob: Next week! At the community center's main hall. It's going to be intense.  
Alice: When exactly? I might actually come and watch this marshmallow madness!  
Bob: Next Tuesday, 7 PM sharp. You really should! It's wilder than you think.  
Alice: Alright, Bob, I'll think about joining your sticky-sweet spectators.
