    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Hey Bob, did you see the news about the Mars Sample Return mission?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! I did! My mind is blown! We're finally bringing Martian rocks back!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Well, *eventually*. It's not like a same-day delivery service. Perseverance has been busy stashing those samples for ages.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Stashing! Like a squirrel burying nuts, but for science! Imagine finding a tiny Martian squirrel!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> (laughs) That would be quite a discovery, Bob. But seriously, getting those samples back is a <strong>monumental task</strong>. They're talking about multiple spacecraft, an orbiter...</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> And then we'll finally know if there are little green men living under the rocks!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Or, more likely, <strong>microscopic extremophiles</strong>, if anything. But even just studying the geology could <strong>unlock secrets</strong> about how planets form.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Nah, I'm <strong>holding out for</strong> alien diamonds. Think of the bling!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> You're <strong>incorrigible</strong>. But the engineering challenge alone is insane. Launching rockets *from* Mars, catching them in orbit... It's like a <strong>cosmic ballet</strong>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> A very expensive cosmic ballet. I heard they're <strong>re-evaluating the budget and timeline</strong>.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> That's right. It's a massive undertaking, and they want to make sure it's done safely and effectively. No rushing something this important.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> So, less 'warp speed' and more 'geological survey pace.' Got it.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly. But imagine when those samples finally land here. It'll be a <strong>game-changer</strong> for science.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> I'm just picturing scientists in hazmat suits poking a rock, then screaming, "It moved!"</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> (rolls eyes playfully) You always come up with the most <strong>dramatic scenarios</strong>, Bob. But I'm excited too. It's a huge step for humanity.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission is an ambitious international collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) aimed at bringing samples of Martian rock, dust, and atmosphere back to Earth for detailed scientific study. NASA's Perseverance rover is currently on Mars, diligently collecting and stashing these samples in sealed tubes on the Martian surface.</p>
    <p>Originally, the plan involved a complex series of missions: a Sample Return Lander with a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) to launch samples from Mars into orbit, and an Earth Return Orbiter to capture them and bring them home. However, due to significant challenges concerning the projected cost, complexity, and timeline of the initial architecture, NASA announced in early 2024 that it is re-evaluating the mission plans. They are exploring alternative, potentially simpler and more cost-effective approaches to achieve the critical goal of bringing these invaluable Martian samples back to Earth by the mid-2030s, rather than the earlier target of 2033. The ultimate objective remains to analyze the samples in advanced terrestrial laboratories, searching for signs of ancient life and unlocking secrets about the Red Planet's geological and climatic history.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "Perseverance has been busy stashing...")</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>The Present Perfect Continuous tense describes an action that started in the past and is still continuing in the present, or has just stopped, but its effects are still visible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + <em>has/have been</em> + verb-<em>ing</em></li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To talk about an action that started in the past and is still ongoing. (e.g., "It <strong>has been raining</strong> all morning.")</li>
                    <li>To talk about a recent activity that has a result or effect in the present. (e.g., "I'm tired because I <strong>have been working</strong> out.")</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "Perseverance <strong>has been busy stashing</strong> those samples for ages." (The action of stashing started in the past and continues or has recently continued.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Modal Verbs of Possibility (e.g., "could unlock secrets," "might find")</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>Modal verbs like "could," "might," and "may" are used to express possibility or likelihood. They indicate that something is possible, but not certain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Could"</strong>: Suggests a general possibility or capability.
                <br><span class="example-sentence">Studying the geology <strong>could unlock</strong> secrets. (It is possible that it will unlock secrets.)</span></li>
            <li><strong>"Might"</strong>: Suggests a weaker possibility or uncertainty.
                <br><span class="example-sentence">We <strong>might find</strong> microscopic extremophiles. (It's possible, but not very certain.)</span></li>
            <li><strong>"May"</strong>: Similar to "might," also indicates possibility, often used in more formal contexts.
                <br><span class="example-sentence">The delay <strong>may cause</strong> further budget increases.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Phrasal Verb: "Holding out for"</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>A phrasal verb is a verb combined with an adverb or a preposition (or sometimes both) to give a new meaning. "Holding out for" is an example.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> To wait for something better or more desirable to happen or appear, refusing to accept anything less.</li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "I'm <strong>holding out for</strong> alien diamonds." (Bob is waiting specifically for alien diamonds, not just any discovery.)</li>
            <li><strong>Other example:</strong> "She's <strong>holding out for</strong> a job with better benefits."</li>
        </ul>
