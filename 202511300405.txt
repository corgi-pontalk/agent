Alice: Hey Bob, how was your weekend?
Bob: Oh, hi Alice! Mine was okay, but yours looks… interesting. Did you wrestle a bear?
Alice: Worse! I survived my first week of homestay. It's an adventure!
Bob: Oh, right! How's it going? Are they nice?
Alice: They're super nice! My host mom, Mrs. Daisy, is a fantastic cook. But she thinks 'dessert' means 'second dinner'.
Bob: Second dinner? Sounds like a challenge!
Alice: It is! Yesterday, she made me eat two slices of apple pie _after_ a huge roast. I almost exploded!
Bob: Haha! Good luck with your stomach, Alice. Any other surprises?
Alice: Well, their dog, Sparky, sleeps on my bed. I woke up with a furry roommate this morning!
Bob: No way! That's... cozy?
Alice: It's certainly warm! And the host dad, Mr. John, tells me bedtime stories. He's 60, I'm 20, but the stories are pretty good!
Bob: Bedtime stories? That's hilarious! What kind of stories?
Alice: Mainly about his pet goldfish when he was a kid. Very dramatic stuff.
Bob: Sounds like a unique experience. Are you practicing your English a lot?
Alice: Oh yes! Mostly at the dinner table, trying to explain why I can't eat a third slice of pie.
Bob: That's a useful skill! Are there any house rules?
Alice: Definitely. No shoes inside – which is common here. And I have to feed Sparky in the morning. That's my main chore.
Bob: At least it's not washing dishes for an hour.
Alice: True! And Sparky is cute, even if he's a bed hog.
Bob: So, all in all, would you recommend homestay?
Alice: Absolutely! It's a bit crazy, a bit new, but I feel like part of the family already. And my English is getting better, even if it's just from talking to a dog.
Bob: Talking to a dog counts! That's immersive!
Alice: Exactly! And I'm learning new words like 'gargantuan' for Mrs. Daisy's portions.
Bob: Haha! You're making me want to try it!
Alice: You should! Just be prepared for surprise desserts and furry bedmates.
Bob: I'll keep that in mind. Do they have Wi-Fi at least?
Alice: Yes, thankfully! Otherwise, I'd probably write letters to my actual family complaining about pie.
Bob: Good to know they're not completely old-fashioned.
Alice: Well, Mr. John still uses a flip phone. But he knows how to share Wi- Fi!
Bob: That's a win! Glad it's going well, Alice.
Alice: Thanks, Bob! See you later!
