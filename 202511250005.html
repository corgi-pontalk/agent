        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, fancy seeing you here! This cafe is absolutely swamped today.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Tell me about it. It’s like the entire world decided to go out simultaneously. Remember when this place used to be half-empty on a Tuesday?
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I know, right? It feels like everyone's finally shedding their couch-potato skins and venturing out. I tried booking a weekend getaway last month, and prices were through the roof!
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, you noticed too? The tourism industry is definitely bouncing back with a vengeance. My cousin works at a hotel, and she says they're packed to the gills almost every night.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That’s good news for the economy, I guess, but bad news for my wallet and my desire for peaceful holidays. I miss the era of empty beaches and quiet museums.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Me too! But I also understand. People have been cooped up for so long, the travel bug has hit everyone hard. Plus, all those deferred holiday plans are finally getting dusted off.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: True. And it's not just international travel. Even local spots are buzzing. I went to the national park last weekend, and it was a parade of hiking boots.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Totally! It's like everyone suddenly remembered how beautiful their own backyard is. Though I think international travel is really picking up steam now too.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Absolutely. I saw a report saying flight bookings are almost at pre-pandemic levels. Can you imagine the airport queues this summer?
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Don't even get me started on airports! But I'm actually planning a trip to Italy soon. Wish me luck with the crowds and the gelato queues.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Italy? Wow! That sounds amazing, Bob. Just prepare for a lot of elbow-jostling at the Colosseum. Is it really worth the hassle, though?
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, Alice, I figure after three years of staring at my living room wall, a little elbow-jostling for authentic pizza is a small price to pay. Plus, I'm hoping to find some spots off the beaten path.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good luck with that! Though I suppose it's a positive sign that people are rediscovering the joy of travel. Maybe I should stop complaining and start booking.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Embrace the chaos, Alice! The world is open for business again. Just maybe bring some noise-cancelling headphones.
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-exchange">
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, good tip! Alright, you've inspired me. Time to bravely face the travel booking websites. Wish me luck!

    <div id="current-situation">
        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The global tourism industry, once severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, is experiencing a robust recovery. Following years of travel restrictions and lockdowns, pent-up demand has fueled a significant resurgence in both domestic and international travel. Many regions are reporting tourism figures nearing or even surpassing pre-pandemic levels. While challenges such as inflation, staffing shortages, and sustainable tourism practices remain, the industry is adapting with renewed vigor. Travelers are rediscovering destinations, from popular city breaks to remote natural parks, eager to make up for lost time and experiences. This recovery is a key indicator of broader economic stabilization and reflects a widespread desire for connection, exploration, and leisure.</p>

    <div id="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="grammar-point">
                <strong>1. Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "have been cooped up")</strong>: This tense is used to describe an action that started in the past and is still continuing, or an action that recently stopped but has a result in the present. It emphasizes the duration of the action.
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure: <strong>Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing</strong></li>
                    <li>Example from dialogue: "People <em>have been cooped up</em> for so long..." (They started being cooped up in the past and the effect/feeling continues or just stopped.)</li>
                    <li>Further example: "I <em>have been studying</em> English for two years."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="grammar-point">
                <strong>2. Phrasal Verbs (e.g., "bouncing back", "picking up steam")</strong>: These are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that, when used together, often have a meaning different from the original verb.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example from dialogue: "The tourism industry is definitely <em>bouncing back</em>..." (recovering)</li>
                    <li>Example from dialogue: "...international travel is really <em>picking up steam</em> now too." (gaining momentum/speed)</li>
                    <li>Further example: "We need to <em>look up</em> the meaning of that word."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="grammar-point">
                <strong>3. Idiomatic Expressions (e.g., "packed to the gills", "through the roof")</strong>: These are phrases where the meaning isn't obvious from the individual words. They add color and naturalness to language.
                <ul>
                    <li>Example from dialogue: "...she says they're <em>packed to the gills</em> almost every night." (very full)</li>
                    <li>Example from dialogue: "...prices were <em>through the roof</em>!" (very high)</li>
                    <li>Further example: "It's raining <em>cats and dogs</em>." (raining very heavily)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="grammar-point">
                <strong>4. Comparatives and Superlatives (implied, e.g., "busier than ever")</strong>: Though not explicitly stated with "than," the dialogue implies comparison, like places being "busier" or "more crowded" than before.
                <ul>
                    <li>Comparative: Used to compare two things (adjective + -er / more + adjective).</li>
                    <li>Superlative: Used to compare three or more things (the + adjective + -est / the most + adjective).</li>
                    <li>Example: "The café is <em>busier</em> now." (Implied comparison to before)</li>
                    <li>Further example: "This is <em>the most delicious</em> cake I've ever eaten."</li>
                </ul>
