    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-content">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no, Bob! This is a disaster!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, what's the problem? You look like you've seen a ghost... or maybe lost your chocolate.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Worse! I can't find my TV remote! My favorite show starts in five minutes!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, the classic remote mystery. It's driving you crazy, huh?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Completely! I've looked everywhere.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, let's think. Have you checked the sofa cushions? Remotes love sofa cushions.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Yes, first place! Not there.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hmm. Maybe it's under the stack of magazines? Or behind the lamp?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Nope, looked there too. It's like it just vanished into thin air!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It could be in the kitchen. Sometimes I take mine with me when I get a snack.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: The kitchen? But why? I wasn't even hungry. Oh wait... I <em>did</em> get ice cream earlier.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: What about the fridge? Or stuck to the bottom of your ice cream tub?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Gasps) The fridge! Bob, you're a genius! (Sound of rummaging) YES! It's here! Next to the mustard!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Next to the mustard? That's a new one! So, that was the problem, a very cold remote.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, yes! Thanks for your help, Bob! You saved my show!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>In everyday life, we often encounter small problems – from losing keys to understanding how a new device works. Knowing how to describe a problem and ask for help is a super useful skill in English. This lesson helps you learn simple phrases to talk about these situations. It's not just about big, complicated issues; it's about making your daily communication smoother and more confident when things don't go exactly as planned. You'll learn how to state what's wrong, suggest solutions, and thank others for their assistance.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. "Can't" (Cannot)</h3>
        <p><strong>"Can't"</strong> is a short form of "cannot." We use it to say that someone or something is unable to do something, or that something is not possible.</p>
        <div class="grammar-example"><em>Examples:</em><br>
            "I <strong>can't</strong> hear you." (I am unable to hear you.)<br>
            "She <strong>can't</strong> swim." (She does not have the ability to swim.)<br>
            "You <strong>can't</strong> park here." (It is not allowed to park here.)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. "Have you checked...?" (Present Perfect for simple questions)</h3>
        <p>For beginners, this phrase is useful for asking if an action has already happened. It implies that the action (checking) might solve the current problem.</p>
        <div class="grammar-example"><em>Examples:</em><br>
            "<strong>Have you checked</strong> your pockets?" (Did you look in your pockets already?)<br>
            "<strong>Have you checked</strong> if the door is locked?" (Did you try to see if the door is locked?)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Expressing Possibility: "Maybe" and "Could be"</h3>
        <p>We use <strong>"maybe"</strong> and <strong>"could be"</strong> to suggest something is possible, but not certain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maybe:</strong> Usually comes at the beginning or middle of a sentence.
                <div class="grammar-example"><em>Example:</em> "<strong>Maybe</strong> it's raining outside." / "It is <strong>maybe</strong> too hot."</div></li>
            <li><strong>Could be:</strong> Often used as "It could be..." to suggest a possible reason or location.
                <div class="grammar-example"><em>Example:</em> "The light is off. <strong>It could be</strong> a power cut." / "My keys are gone. They <strong>could be</strong> in the car."</div></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>4. Prepositions of Place</h3>
        <p>These words tell us where something is. In our dialogue, we used many!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>under:</strong> below something.
                <div class="grammar-example"><em>Example:</em> "The cat is <strong>under</strong> the table."</div></li>
            <li><strong>behind:</strong> at the back of something.
                <div class="grammar-example"><em>Example:</em> "The pen is <strong>behind</strong> the book."</div></li>
            <li><strong>in:</strong> inside something.
                <div class="grammar-example"><em>Example:</em> "The juice is <strong>in</strong> the fridge."</div></li>
            <li><strong>next to:</strong> beside something.
                <div class="grammar-example"><em>Example:</em> "The chair is <strong>next to</strong> the desk."</div></li>
            <li><strong>on:</strong> on the surface of something.
                <div class="grammar-example"><em>Example:</em> "The phone is <strong>on</strong> the bed."</div></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
