Alice : Hey Bob, what are you up to? Bob : Hi Alice! Just thinking about movies. You know, my favorite one, 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'? Alice : Oh, *that* movie? Bob, we talked about this! It's... a classic, if you like flying vegetables. Bob : But it's art! The suspense! The drama! The *tomatoes*! Alice : I think my cat makes more suspenseful films when it chases a laser pointer. Have you seen 'The Cat Who Could Fly' on Catflix? Bob : Catflix? Is that even real? I thought you liked serious dramas! Alice : I do! But sometimes, you need a break. 'The Cat Who Could Fly' has amazing special effects for a cat. And no killer tomatoes. Bob : Fine, fine. But what about that new superhero movie? 'Captain Awesome vs. The Giant Rubber Duck'? Alice : I saw the trailer! It looks... interesting. Is the duck the hero or the villain? Bob : Both! It's a complicated relationship. Maybe we should watch it together this weekend? Alice : Only if you promise to stop talking about 'Killer Tomatoes' for a whole hour. Bob : Deal! And maybe we can watch 'The Cat Who Could Fly' afterward? Just for research. Alice : Hmm, that's a tough negotiation, Bob. But okay! Popcorn's on me. Bob : Awesome! I'll bring the... uh... tomato juice? Just kidding! Alice : Bob!
