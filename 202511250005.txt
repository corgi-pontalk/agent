Alice: Hey Bob, fancy seeing you here! This cafe is absolutely swamped today.
Bob: Alice! Tell me about it. It’s like the entire world decided to go out simultaneously. Remember when this place used to be half-empty on a Tuesday?
Alice: I know, right? It feels like everyone's finally shedding their couch- potato skins and venturing out. I tried booking a weekend getaway last month, and prices were through the roof!
Bob: Oh, you noticed too? The tourism industry is definitely bouncing back with a vengeance. My cousin works at a hotel, and she says they're packed to the gills almost every night.
Alice: That’s good news for the economy, I guess, but bad news for my wallet and my desire for peaceful holidays. I miss the era of empty beaches and quiet museums.
Bob: Me too! But I also understand. People have been cooped up for so long, the travel bug has hit everyone hard. Plus, all those deferred holiday plans are finally getting dusted off.
Alice: True. And it's not just international travel. Even local spots are buzzing. I went to the national park last weekend, and it was a parade of hiking boots.
Bob: Totally! It's like everyone suddenly remembered how beautiful their own backyard is. Though I think international travel is really picking up steam now too.
Alice: Absolutely. I saw a report saying flight bookings are almost at pre- pandemic levels. Can you imagine the airport queues this summer?
Bob: Don't even get me started on airports! But I'm actually planning a trip to Italy soon. Wish me luck with the crowds and the gelato queues.
Alice: Italy? Wow! That sounds amazing, Bob. Just prepare for a lot of elbow- jostling at the Colosseum. Is it really worth the hassle, though?
Bob: Well, Alice, I figure after three years of staring at my living room wall, a little elbow-jostling for authentic pizza is a small price to pay. Plus, I'm hoping to find some spots off the beaten path.
Alice: Good luck with that! Though I suppose it's a positive sign that people are rediscovering the joy of travel. Maybe I should stop complaining and start booking.
Bob: Exactly! Embrace the chaos, Alice! The world is open for business again. Just maybe bring some noise-cancelling headphones.
Alice: Haha, good tip! Alright, you've inspired me. Time to bravely face the travel booking websites. Wish me luck!
