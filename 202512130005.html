        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, did you see the French Open results? What in the world just happened?</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice, it was... wild. Utterly, inexplicably wild.</p>
            <p><b>Alice</b>: "Wild" is an understatement! Did you see who won the men's singles?</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: You mean <i>Gerald from accounting</i>? I nearly choked on my croissant when I saw that name pop up!</p>
            <p><b>Alice</b>: Exactly! And the women's final? A wildcard ranked 300th, who mostly plays in local park tournaments!</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: I know! My tennis bracket is in tatters. I had all the usual suspects making it to the finals, Nadal, Djokovic... you know, the legends!</p>
            <p><b>Alice</b>: Mine too! I swear the universe just decided to prank us tennis fans this year. It felt like watching a parallel universe Grand Slam.</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: It really did. What about Wimbledon? I heard rumors of something even stranger.</p>
            <p><b>Alice</b>: Wimbledon was even crazier! A doubles team of a former pop star and a retired astronaut won. They apparently perfected zero-gravity serves.</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: No way, Alice! You're pulling my leg!</p>
            <p><b>Alice</b>: I am not, Bob! The commentators kept calling them 'The Celestial Smashers'. Federer himself announced his <i>third</i> comeback just to try and figure out their technique.</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: Zero-gravity serves... I can't even process that. And the US Open?</p>
            <p><b>Alice</b>: The US Open had a cat as a ball kid that kept interfering with play. It even batted a ball back over the net once!</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: Oh, I <b>did</b> see that clip! It was adorable but utterly chaotic. The umpire actually gave it a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct!</p>
            <p><b>Alice</b>: These 2025 Grand Slams are definitely going down in history for all the wrong, yet incredibly entertaining, reasons.</p>
            <p><b>Bob</b>: Definitely. My therapist says I need to accept the 'new normal' of tennis. I think I need a new therapist, or maybe just a long nap.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The year 2025 has truly redefined the landscape of professional tennis. What began as a promising season quickly devolved into a series of unprecedented and often bizarre events across all four Grand Slam tournaments. Top seeds crashed out in early rounds, unknown wildcard entries triumphed over seasoned professionals, and the world witnessed everything from unusual weather phenomena to unexpected animal interventions on court. The established order of the ATP and WTA tours has been completely upended, leaving fans, pundits, and players alike grappling with a "new normal" where anything seems possible, and predictability is a thing of the past. The tennis world is in a state of delightful, yet utterly chaotic, shock.</p>

            <li><b>Idiomatic Expressions</b>
                <p>Idioms are phrases or expressions whose meaning cannot be understood from the literal meanings of its individual words. They add color, naturalness, and often humor to English conversations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examples from the dialogue: "choked on my croissant" (meaning extremely surprised), "pulling my leg" (meaning joking or teasing), "in tatters" (meaning ruined).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Structure: Subject + <b>did</b> + base form of the verb.</li>
                    <li>Example from the dialogue: "Oh, I <b>did</b> see that clip!" (This emphasizes that Bob really saw it, perhaps confirming something strongly or correcting an assumption.)</li>
                    <li>Usage: It can be used to contradict someone, confirm something strongly, or express surprise. For instance, if someone says "You didn't do your homework," you might reply, "I <b>did</b> do my homework!"</li>
