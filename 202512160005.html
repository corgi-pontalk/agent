    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Bob, guess what! I saw a clip of surfing from the Olympics last night, and it was incredible!</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice, you mean surfing is *actually* in the Olympics now? I thought that was just a <strong>pipe dream</strong> for wave-obsessed fanatics!</p>
        <p>Alice: It is! It made its debut in Tokyo 2020 (held in 2021, of course). I mean, can you imagine standing on that podium, board under your arm, knowing you conquered the waves *and* the world?</p>
        <p>Bob: Sounds pretty epic. Though I always pictured Olympic athletes doing something... less reliant on <strong>Mother Nature's mood swings</strong>. Like, what if the waves just decide to take a day off?</p>
        <p>Alice: That's part of the challenge, silly! It adds an element of unpredictability and skill. Plus, it's not just about big waves; it's about technique, style, and how you read the ocean.</p>
        <p>Bob: So, no synchronized surfing then? No perfectly aligned duck dives? Shame. That would have been truly Olympic.</p>
        <p>Alice: (rolls her eyes) No, Bob, no synchronized surfing. But it's brought a whole new level of cool to the Games, don't you think? It's all about youth culture, pushing boundaries.</p>
        <p>Bob: I suppose it beats watching competitive synchronized napping. Though I could probably medal in that. But seriously, it's been <strong>a long time coming</strong> for surfers, hasn't it?</p>
        <p>Alice: Absolutely! Surfing has such a rich history, from ancient Polynesians to Duke Kahanamoku, who actually campaigned for it to be an Olympic sport way back in the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Bob: Duke Kahanamoku? The Hawaiian swimmer? Wow, so this isn't just a recent fad. It's like, a century-old dream finally <strong>catching a big wave</strong>.</p>
        <p>Alice: Exactly! It's been quite a journey. And now, seeing athletes from all over the world, not just traditional surfing nations, competing? It's amazing for the sport's global reach.</p>
        <p>Bob: So, does this mean my "extreme napping" might get Olympic recognition if I lobby hard enough? Perhaps under "Mental Fortitude Sports"?</p>
        <p>Alice: (laughs) You wish! But hey, if surfing can do it, maybe anything's possible. Now, are you ready to <strong>trade your armchair for a surfboard</strong>? We could try a beginner's lesson!</p>
        <p>Bob: Whoa, slow down there, wave whisperer. One step at a time. First, I need to master standing up on *dry land* without losing my balance. Baby steps to Olympic glory!</p>
        <p>Alice: (grinning) That's the spirit, Bob! We'll get you there. Or at least get you wet.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Surfing officially made its debut as an Olympic sport at the Tokyo 2020 Games (which were postponed and held in 2021 due to the pandemic). Its inclusion was part of the International Olympic Committee's efforts to appeal to a younger audience and embrace sports with strong youth culture and global appeal. Surfing is scored based on a combination of factors including the difficulty of maneuvers, innovation, variety, speed, power, and flow of the ride.</p>
    <p>The sport has been confirmed for future Olympic Games, including Paris 2024 (with competitions held at Teahupo'o in Tahiti, French Polynesia, known for its powerful waves) and Los Angeles 2028, solidifying its place in the Olympic movement after decades of advocacy from the surfing community.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Present Perfect (Simple and Continuous)</h3>
        <p>The Present Perfect tense is used for actions that started in the past and continue to the present, or for actions completed recently with a present result. The continuous form emphasizes the duration of the action.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Formation (Simple):</strong> <em>has/have + past participle</em></li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue:</strong> "it's <strong>brought</strong> a whole new level of cool to the Games" (The action of bringing started in the past and its effect is still relevant). "It's <strong>been</strong> quite a journey."</li>
            <li><strong>Example (Simple):</strong> She <strong>has lived</strong> in this city for five years. (Still lives here)</li>
            <li><strong>Formation (Continuous):</strong> <em>has/have + been + -ing verb</em></li>
            <li><strong>Example (Continuous):</strong> I <strong>have been studying</strong> English all morning. (Started in the morning, still studying or just finished)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Speculation/Possibility</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs like <em>must</em>, <em>might</em>, and <em>could</em> are used to express varying degrees of certainty or possibility about present or past events.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Must (have + past participle):</strong> Used for high certainty or logical deduction about a past event.
                <ul><li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "It <strong>must have been</strong> incredible!" (Alice is very sure it was incredible).</li>
                    <li><em>Example:</em> He's soaking wet. It <strong>must have been raining</strong> outside.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Might / Could (have + past participle):</strong> Used for possibility or suggestion about past or present events. <em>Might</em> suggests a slightly lower possibility than <em>could</em>, but they are often interchangeable.
                <ul><li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "my "extreme napping" <strong>might get</strong> Olympic recognition" (Bob is suggesting a possibility, perhaps humorous). "We <strong>could try</strong> a beginner's lesson!" (Alice is making a suggestion).</li>
                    <li><em>Example:</em> She <strong>might have forgotten</strong> about our appointment. (It's possible she forgot).</li></ul>
