        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, you won't believe what I just saw on Instagram! Someone posted photos from their European trip, and now I'm absolutely bursting with wanderlust.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Oh, Alice, tell me about it! My feed is full of those too. It just makes you want to pack a bag and go, doesn't it? What's your ultimate dream trip to Europe?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Ooh, tough question! But definitely starting in Paris. I'd have to see the Eiffel Tower, of course, and then get completely lost in the Louvre for a day.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Yes, Paris is a must! I'd swing by Rome next, hands down. Imagine standing in the Colosseum, feeling all that history. And then, gelato for days!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Gelato, yes! And pasta! I'd want to eat my weight in authentic Italian food. Then maybe a scenic train ride through the Swiss Alps? Just for the dramatic views.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Swiss Alps, brilliant! I'd follow that up with Barcelona. Tapas, Sagrada Familia, maybe even try to learn a few Spanish phrases. "Una cerveza, por favor!"</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Haha, good luck with that, Bob! I'd probably just point at things. But thinking about it, imagine the food tour! Croissants in France, pasta in Italy, paella in Spain… my stomach is rumbling just thinking about it.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Mine too! This is going to cost a fortune, though. We’d have to win the lottery, or maybe just *really* save up. Like, no more avocado toast for a year.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> A year without avocado toast? Now that’s dedication to the dream! But seriously, if I had unlimited money, I would stay for months, really immerse myself in the culture.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Me too! And I’d bring a friend, someone who's up for anything, even getting lost in a labyrinth of ancient streets. Someone like… well, you, Alice!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Aww, Bob, you flatter me! I’d love to get lost with you. As long as we have a map, or at least a working phone for directions. My sense of direction is legendary, but not in a good way.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Mine isn’t much better, so we’d probably end up in a random village asking for directions in mime. It would be an adventure! We could even hit up Oktoberfest in Germany!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Oh, a beer festival! Now you’re talking! We’d have to practice our "Prost!"</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Definitely! So, dream trip to Europe: Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Swiss Alps, and Oktoberfest. All funded by… our wildest dreams and perhaps a very serious savings plan.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Sounds like a plan, Bob! We should start a "Europe Fund" jar. I’m already looking forward to it!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Me too, Alice! Me too! Let's make it happen someday.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Dream trips to Europe have always been popular, but in recent years, interest has surged significantly. Many people, especially younger generations, prioritize experiences over possessions, making travel a top aspiration. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok fuel this desire, showcasing stunning European landscapes, vibrant city life, and unique cultural experiences, creating a strong sense of "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out) and inspiring wanderlust.</p>
        <p>Affordable air travel options (like budget airlines) have made European destinations more accessible than ever, even for those on a tighter budget. Backpacking, interrailing, and exploring multiple countries in one trip are common ways to experience the continent. There's a growing trend towards authentic, immersive travel, where visitors seek to "live like a local," explore off-the-beaten-path locations, and engage with local culture through food tours, cooking classes, and language exchanges, rather than just hitting major tourist landmarks.</p>
        <p>While the dream is strong, the reality often involves significant planning and saving. Factors like the cost of living in popular cities, visa requirements, and language barriers can be challenges. However, the rise of remote work and digital nomadism has also enabled some to extend their dream trips into longer stays, blending work with exploration.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

        <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Wishes, Possibilities, and Advice</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs like 'would', 'could', and 'should' are often used when talking about dreams, plans, and hypothetical situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Would:</strong> Used for hypothetical situations, desires, or polite offers.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: I <strong>would love</strong> to go to Japan someday. (desire)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: If I had more time, I <strong>would visit</strong> every museum. (hypothetical)</p></li>
            <li><strong>Could:</strong> Used for possibility or ability.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: We <strong>could</strong> go to Italy next summer if we save enough. (possibility)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: I <strong>could</strong> try speaking some French while I'm there. (ability/possibility)</p></li>
            <li><strong>Should:</strong> Used for advice, recommendation, or obligation.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: We <strong>should</strong> start a "Europe Fund" jar. (recommendation)</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Second Conditional (Type 2)</h3>
        <p>The second conditional is used to talk about unreal or improbable situations in the present or future, and their hypothetical results. It's perfect for discussing dream scenarios.</p>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> If + Past Simple, Would + Base Verb</p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: If I <strong>had</strong> unlimited money, I <strong>would stay</strong> for months. (It's unlikely I have unlimited money, so it's an unreal situation.)</p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: If I <strong>won</strong> the lottery, I <strong>would travel</strong> the world. (Winning the lottery is improbable.)</p>
        <p>This structure emphasizes that the condition is not real or highly unlikely to happen, but we're imagining what would happen if it were.</p>
