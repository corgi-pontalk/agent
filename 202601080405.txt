Alice: Bob, remember that disastrous cake we tried to bake last month?  
Bob: Alice! Oh no, don't remind me! My kitchen still smells of burnt sugar and forgotten dreams.  
Alice: We really needed to _work together_ better, didn't we?  
Bob: Definitely! I thought I was _pulling my weight_ by just... supervising the flour.  
Alice: Supervising? Bob, you were supposed to mix! And you used a spoon when we needed a whisk!  
Bob: Well, we weren't exactly _on the same page_ about the recipe, were we? Some parts said 'mix', others said 'stir vigorously'... confusing!  
Alice: You put salt instead of sugar! How can two people be so completely _out of sync_?  
Bob: Hey, it was a "team effort" to misunderstand the instructions, I tell you! A glorious, salty-sweet mess!  
Alice: More like a 'team disaster'! Next time, we should _divide the tasks_ clearly.  
Bob: Okay, okay. Next time, I'll be the 'chief taste-tester'. You handle everything else, from measuring to decorating.  
Alice: That's not teamwork, Bob! Teamwork means _everyone contributes_ equally to the actual work!  
Bob: Fine, fine. Maybe we need to _brainstorm_ our roles better before we start. Like, a pre-baking strategy meeting.  
Alice: Exactly! Or just order a cake. Much safer for everyone involved.  
Bob: But where's the fun in that? We need to _learn to collaborate_ and make our _own_ delicious (or at least edible) cake!  
Alice: Right. But maybe with oven mitts and a fire extinguisher on standby next time.
