    <h1>Dialogue</h1>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, guess what? I'm planning a camping trip next month!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice, a camping trip? Really? Are you sure you're not confusing 'camping' with 'glamping' again?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, very funny! No, real camping this time. Stars, campfire, maybe a few mosquitoes...</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Mosquitoes? Oh no. Do we need a tent?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Of course, Bob! And sleeping bags. And maybe some bug spray for you.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Good idea. What about food? Are we eating tree bark?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> No tree bark! We'll bring marshmallows for s'mores and hot dogs for the campfire. Delicious!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> S'mores sound good. But... what if it rains?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> We'll check the weather. And a good tent keeps us dry. Don't worry so much!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, okay. But no scary stories, right? I heard there are bears in some camping spots.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bears? Bob, we're going to a family-friendly campground, not the wilderness! Just squirrels and maybe a friendly rabbit.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A friendly rabbit sounds much better. So, when is this adventurous trip?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> The first weekend of July. Two nights. It's going to be so much fun!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Two nights? Wow. Okay, I'll start practicing pitching a tent in my living room.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Perfect! See? You're a natural camper already. Just don't forget your pillow!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Pillow? Definitely. And my lucky camping hat!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Sounds like you're ready! I'll send you the packing list.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Great! Thanks, Alice!</p>

    <h1>Current Situation</h1>
    <p>
        Camping is a popular outdoor activity where people spend one or more nights away from home, often sleeping in a tent or a recreational vehicle (RV). It's a great way to escape the busy city life and enjoy nature. People go camping to relax, explore forests, mountains, or lakes, and spend time with friends and family. Common activities include hiking, fishing, cooking over a campfire, and stargazing. Before going, it's important to prepare a packing list, check the weather, and choose a suitable campground.

    <h1>Grammar Points</h1>

    <h2>1. Present Continuous for Future Plans</h2>
    <p>We often use the <strong>present continuous tense (verb "to be" + -ing form)</strong> to talk about future plans that are already arranged or decided, especially when a specific time or date is mentioned.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>"I'm <strong>planning</strong> a camping trip next month!"</em> (She has already decided and is making arrangements.)</li>
        <li><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>"We're <strong>going</strong> to a family-friendly campground."</em> (The destination is set.)</li>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>My sister <strong>is visiting</strong> us next weekend.</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>They <strong>are having</strong> a party on Saturday.</em></p>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. "Going to" for Future Intentions</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>"going to" (verb "to be" + going to + base form of verb)</strong> to talk about future plans or intentions, or to make predictions based on present evidence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bob:</strong> <em>"Are we <strong>going to eat</strong> tree bark?"</em> (Bob is asking about their future food plans.)</li>
        <li><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>"It's <strong>going to be</strong> so much fun!"</em> (Alice is predicting a fun experience.)</li>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>I'm <strong>going to learn</strong> a new language next year.</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em>Look at those dark clouds! It's <strong>going to rain</strong>.</em></p>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Basic Questions with "Do" and "Wh-words"</h2>
    <p>To ask simple questions in English, especially about general facts or needs, we often use <strong>"Do"</strong> (for I/you/we/they) or <strong>"Does"</strong> (for he/she/it). For specific information, we use <strong>Wh-words (What, When, Where, Who, Why, How)</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bob:</strong> <em>"<strong>Do</strong> we need a tent?"</em> (Asking about a general necessity.)</li>
        <li><strong>Bob:</strong> <em>"<strong>What about</strong> food?"</em> (Asking for information about food.)</li>
        <li><strong>Bob:</strong> <em>"So, <strong>when is</strong> this adventurous trip?"</em> (Asking about the time of the trip.)</li>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Do</strong> you like coffee?</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Where</strong> are you going?</em></p>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Imperatives (Commands and Instructions)</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>imperatives</strong> to give commands, instructions, or make suggestions. They usually start directly with the base form of the verb. For negative commands, we use <strong>"Don't" + base form of verb</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>"<strong>Don't worry</strong> so much!"</em> (A negative command/suggestion.)</li>
        <li><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>"Just <strong>don't forget</strong> your pillow!"</em> (A negative instruction.)</li>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Open</strong> the door.</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Don't touch</strong> that!</em></p>
    </ul>
