Alice: Hey, Bob! Did you get an invitation for Tina's birthday party?
Bob: Oh, Alice! Yes, I did! It's next Saturday, right?
Alice: That's the one! Are you going?
Bob: Absolutely! Tina throws the best parties. You have to come!
Alice: I wouldn't miss it! But I have a problem.
Bob: What's up? Did you forget what to wear?
Alice: No, silly! I can't think of a good gift. Any ideas?
Bob: Hmm... Last year I got her a giant inflatable flamingo. It was a hit!
Alice: A flamingo? That's... unique. Maybe something a bit more practical this year?
Bob: Practical? For Tina? She loves silly things! How about a really fluffy monster-shaped hat?
Alice: (Laughing) Bob, you're impossible! She already has three. I was thinking of a nice book or some fancy tea.
Bob: Oh, a book! That's actually a good idea. Or, we could bake her a cake together!
Alice: That sounds fun! But I'm terrible at baking. My cakes always look like lopsided volcanoes.
Bob: No worries! I'm a baking genius! We can make a chocolate lava cake! It'll be delicious, even if it looks like a volcano.
Alice: (Smiling) Okay, Bob, you're on! A joint volcano cake it is!
Bob: Perfect! See you at the party, Alice!
