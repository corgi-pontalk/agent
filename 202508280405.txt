Alice: Oh, hey Bob! I'm trying to write my self-introduction for my new online English class. It's so hard!
Bob: Self-introduction, Alice? For a _class_? Just say "Hi, I'm Alice, I like cats." Done.
Alice: No, Bob! It needs to be professional. Listen: "My name is Alice. I am a student. I live in London. My hobbies are reading and quiet contemplation."
Bob: "Quiet contemplation"? Alice, are you secretly a wise old owl? That sounds like a sleepy robot.
Alice: It's serious! What about you? How would _you_ introduce yourself?
Bob: Me? Easy. "Hello, everyone! I'm Bob, the human tornado of fun! I love pizza, video games, and making Alice laugh."
Alice: "Human tornado"? Nobody will take you seriously! And you live in London, too, remember?
Bob: Well, yeah. But "I live in London" sounds so... plain. Maybe "My current location is a fantastic city known as London!"
Alice: Bob, it's for beginners. They need simple English! "I live in London" is perfect.
Bob: Okay, okay. So, "My name is Alice. I am a student. I live in London. My hobbies are... what _are_ your real hobbies, Alice? Not sleepy owl stuff."
Alice: Hmm. I like watching movies and baking cupcakes. And listening to pop music!
Bob: See! Much better! "My hobbies are watching movies, baking cupcakes, and listening to pop music." Now add "Nice to meet you all!"
Alice: That sounds... much more like me! Thank you, Bob. "Nice to meet you all!"
Bob: You're welcome, Alice. Maybe I should be an introduction consultant. For a small fee, of course.
Alice: (laughs) Oh, Bob! You're silly. But my introduction is ready now!
