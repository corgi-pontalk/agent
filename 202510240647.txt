Alice : Hey Bob, you look a bit tired today! Long day? Bob : Alice! Yeah, it's not the day, it's my tiny apartment. I tripped over my own shoes this morning because there's just no space! Alice : Oh no! Is it really that small? Bob : It's like a shoebox! One bedroom, a tiny living room, and a kitchen that doubles as a hallway. Alice : Wow! My house is bigger, but sometimes I can't find anything. It has three bedrooms. Bob : Three bedrooms? I could get lost in there! I only have _one_ room, practically. Alice : We also have a big garden. My dog, Sparky, loves to play there. Bob : A garden? I have a window box with a dying plant. That's my "garden". Alice : Is there anything you like about your place? Bob : Hmm, the coffee shop downstairs is great. Does that count as part of my house? Alice : Haha, nice try! Well, my favorite room is the kitchen. It's really sunny. Bob : Sunny kitchen! Mine is so dark, I need a flashlight to find the cereal. Alice : You should come over sometime! We can cook in my sunny kitchen. Bob : Really? Yes, please! I'll bring my own flashlight, just in case. Alice : No need! And Sparky would love to meet you. Bob : Perfect! Maybe I'll learn how to find my cereal without tripping.
