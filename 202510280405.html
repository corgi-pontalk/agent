    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, guess what I saw? This tiny, tiny cupcake for... ten dollars!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Ten dollars? Alice, that's insane! Was it made of gold?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Almost! It was just a regular vanilla cupcake. I couldn't believe it.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Wow. That's way too much for a cupcake. I bought this new hat yesterday, and it was only five dollars.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Only five dollars? That's a great deal, Bob! It looks good on you.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Thanks! I thought so too. How much was your coffee this morning?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Mine was three dollars. A bit expensive for just black coffee, but it was really good.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Three dollars isn't too bad if it's good coffee. But ten dollars for a cupcake... I'm still thinking about it!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: I know, right? It makes my coffee feel cheap! What about that new game you wanted? How much is it?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Oh, 'Galactic Sweeper'? It's fifty dollars. A bit pricey, but I really want it.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Fifty dollars... that's quite a lot. Are you sure it's worth it?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: I hope so! Maybe I'll wait for a sale. How much is a movie ticket these days?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Around twelve dollars here. But popcorn is like, eight dollars!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Eight dollars for popcorn? That's crazy! Maybe I should just bring my own snacks.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Good idea, Bob! We should start a 'cheap snacks for movies' club.</p>
