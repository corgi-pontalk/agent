Alice: Bob! Is that really you?
Bob: Alice! Wow, long time no see! How have you been?
Alice: I'm great, thanks! You too! How do you usually keep in touch with everyone? My phone is always busy!
Bob: Haha, tell me about it! I mostly text my friends. It's fast and easy.
Alice: True. I like video calls too, especially with family far away. It's nice to see their faces.
Bob: Oh yeah, video calls are great! I use them for my sister who lives abroad. We chat every weekend.
Alice: That’s good! Sometimes I forget to reply to messages for days. My friends think I've disappeared!
Bob: Don't worry, Alice, you're not alone! I once replied to a "Happy New Year" text in February. My friend just sent back a "LOL."
Alice: (Laughing) That's even worse than me! I guess we're both a bit forgetful.
Bob: Maybe we need a personal assistant just for keeping in touch!
Alice: Or maybe we should just make more time. Like, "Hey Bob, let's grab coffee next week!"
Bob: That's a fantastic idea! I'd love to catch up properly.
Alice: Me too! I'll text you later to set a time.
Bob: Sounds good! Don't forget to send that text, okay? No February replies!
Alice: (Smiling) I promise! It was great running into you!
Bob: You too, Alice! Talk soon!
