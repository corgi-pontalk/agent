Alice: Hey Bob, you look like you just finished a K-drama marathon. Are those eye bags or dramatic shadows?
Bob: Alice! You caught me. I just binged 'Squid Game 2: The Ramen Debt'. It's intense!
Alice: Squid Game 2? I thought the original was enough to give me nightmares.
Bob: Oh, this one's different! It's about a character trying to pay off their instant noodle debt. Surprisingly gripping.
Alice: Sounds... delicious? So, what's with the obsession with Korean culture lately? Everywhere I look, it's BTS or Blackpink.
Bob: It's not 'lately', Alice, it's a global phenomenon! K-pop, K-dramas, K-beauty, K-food... it's all just chef's kiss.
Alice: Okay, 'chef's kiss' for a culture? You're really into it. Have you tried making your own kimchi yet?
Bob: Don't tempt me! My apartment already smells vaguely of garlic and ambition. But I did nail the tteokbokki last week.
Alice: Tteokbokki? The spicy rice cakes? I tried that once, nearly set my mouth on fire.
Bob: That's the beauty of it! The spice, the chewiness... it's an experience. You know, I'm even learning some Korean phrases.
Alice: Jinja? Really? So, if I ask you to 'annyeonghaseyo' me, you'd understand?
Bob: Of course! Annyeonghaseyo, Alice! See? And 'kamsahamnida' for teaching me. It's surprisingly intuitive.
Alice: You're getting dangerously close to booking a flight to Seoul, aren't you?
Bob: Maybe! But first, I need to master the 'finger heart'. It's essential for blending in.
Alice: You're hilarious, Bob. Maybe I'll join you for some K-BBQ sometime. You can practice your 'Oppa!' on the waiter.
Bob: It's a date! But I'll stick to 'jeogiyo' for the waiter. 'Oppa' is more for... a K-drama moment.
