    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, what are you up to?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hi Alice! Just thinking about movies. You know, my favorite one, 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, *that* movie? Bob, we talked about this! It's... a classic, if you like flying vegetables.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: But it's art! The suspense! The drama! The *tomatoes*!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I think my cat makes more suspenseful films when it chases a laser pointer. Have you seen 'The Cat Who Could Fly' on Catflix?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Catflix? Is that even real? I thought you liked serious dramas!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I do! But sometimes, you need a break. 'The Cat Who Could Fly' has amazing special effects for a cat. And no killer tomatoes.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Fine, fine. But what about that new superhero movie? 'Captain Awesome vs. The Giant Rubber Duck'?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I saw the trailer! It looks... interesting. Is the duck the hero or the villain?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Both! It's a complicated relationship. Maybe we should watch it together this weekend?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Only if you promise to stop talking about 'Killer Tomatoes' for a whole hour.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Deal! And maybe we can watch 'The Cat Who Could Fly' afterward? Just for research.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hmm, that's a tough negotiation, Bob. But okay! Popcorn's on me.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Awesome! I'll bring the... uh... tomato juice? Just kidding!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob!</p>
