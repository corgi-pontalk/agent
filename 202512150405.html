    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, what's up? I was just thinking about lunch.</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! Perfect timing! I'm <em>always</em> thinking about food. What's your favorite thing to eat?</p>
        <p>Alice: Hmm, that's a tough one! I really like pizza. A classic, you know?</p>
        <p>Bob: Pizza is good, but for me, it's tacos. Specifically, crunchy beef tacos with extra cheese. And guacamole!</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh, tacos are great! But 'extra cheese' and guacamole for you? I'm not surprised!</p>
        <p>Bob: Hey! You can never have too much cheese or guacamole. What about dessert? Do you like sweets?</p>
        <p>Alice: Definitely! I love chocolate cake. Especially with vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>Bob: Chocolate cake is divine! But my heart belongs to strawberry cheesecake. The creamy kind, with a thick crust!</p>
        <p>Alice: Wow, you really have strong opinions about food, Bob!</p>
        <p>Bob: It's important, Alice! Food is life! Do you like vegetables?</p>
        <p>Alice: Some of them! I like carrots and broccoli. Not a big fan of spinach, though.</p>
        <p>Bob: Broccoli is okay. But I <em>love</em> roasted potatoes. They're crunchy outside, soft inside... perfection!</p>
        <p>Alice: Roasted potatoes are amazing, I agree! You make me hungry now.</p>
        <p>Bob: Mission accomplished! So, pizza or tacos for our next lunch?</p>
        <p>Alice: Hmm, maybe both? We can order a little bit of everything!</p>
        <p>Bob: Excellent idea, Alice! My kind of friend!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>
        Talking about food you like is a fantastic way for English beginners to start conversations! Everyone eats, so it's a universal topic. It helps you learn common food vocabulary, express your preferences (like "I like...", "I love...", "I don't like..."), and use descriptive words such as "delicious," "sweet," or "crunchy." It's also a great way to make friends and discover new things about people's cultures and tastes. Plus, who doesn't love talking about yummy food?

                <h3>Expressing Likes and Dislikes (Verbs 'Like' and 'Love')</h3>
                <p>We use these verbs to tell people what foods we enjoy or don't enjoy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use "<strong>I like...</strong>" for things you enjoy. <br><em>Example:</em> "I like pizza."</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"What's your favorite...?"</strong>: Used to ask about a specific top choice.
                        <br><em>Example:</em> "What's your favorite food?" / "What's your favorite dessert?"</li>
                    <li><strong>"Do you like...?"</strong>: Used for general preferences, usually answered with "Yes, I do" or "No, I don't."
