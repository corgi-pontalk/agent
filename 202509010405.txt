Alice: Bob, are you awake? You looked like you were dreaming about pizza during the lecture!
Bob: Alice! Oh, hey. Not pizza, but maybe a nap. This English class is... intense.
Alice: Intense? It's "Hello, my name is Bob." What's confusing you?
Bob: Well, the teacher keeps saying things. Like, "Open your books to page ten!" And I'm always on page five.
Alice: _(chuckles)_ That's "Open your books." Very important!
Bob: And then she says, "Listen carefully!" But my brain is still on page five.
Alice: You need to focus! What if you don't understand something?
Bob: I usually just nod. But last time, she asked, "Does anyone have a question?" and I accidentally said "Yes!"
Alice: Oh no! What did you ask?
Bob: I panicked! I just blurted out, "What does 'pen' mean?" She held up a pen.
Alice: _(laughs hard)_ Bob! That's a basic word! You could have said, "Can you speak more slowly, please?"
Bob: Good point! Or, "Could you repeat that?" I always forget those.
Alice: Or, "Excuse me, I don't understand." It's okay to ask!
Bob: You're right. I guess I need to learn this "classroom English" properly. Otherwise, I'll be asking what "chair" means next week.
Alice: Exactly! Now, _open your mind_ to learning! We have a quiz tomorrow.
Bob: A quiz?! Oh no, I need to "listen carefully" now!
