Alice: Bob, you won't believe what I just read! It's actually a bit disturbing.
Bob: Oh no, Alice, not another doomsday scenario about alien invasions or self-aware toasters?
Alice: Worse! They've found microplastics inside people. Like, actually *inside* us!
Bob: Wait, what? Are you telling me I’m basically a human plastic bag now? Is that why I feel so… resilient?
Alice: Don't joke! Scientists are finding them in our blood, organs, even placentas. It's everywhere.
Bob: So, that "fresh ocean breeze" I was enjoying the other day probably came with a side of plastic confetti? No wonder my super-sight isn't kicking in!
Alice: Exactly! We eat it, drink it, breathe it. Think of all the takeout containers, the synthetic clothes...
Bob: My Achilles heel! My love for instant ramen has betrayed me. Maybe I should start eating only things grown in a pristine, air-filtered bubble.
Alice: Good luck with that. Even the rain carries it. We're practically swimming in it.
Bob: So, if I get a paper cut, will I bleed glitter? This explains so much about my sparkly personality!
Alice: You're impossible! But seriously, it makes you think about what we're actually putting into our bodies.
Bob: True. So, does this mean my eventual superhero name will be Captain Plastic? With powers of… well, resisting corrosion?
Alice: More like Captain Concern! We really need to be more mindful.
Bob: Right. Maybe it's time to invest in a personal, full-body microplastic filter. Or just embrace my inner Tupperware.
Alice: I think I'll stick with water filters for now. And less plastic-wrapped everything. You should too!
