    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, you look like you've seen a ghost. What's up?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, it's worse than a ghost. It's... presentation day tomorrow!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no! The dreaded PowerPoint monster!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! My slides are more confused than I am.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Did you practice? Even just in front of your cat?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: My cat just yawned and walked away. Not a great audience.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Maybe try looking at the back wall, not people's faces. It helps with nerves.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: But what if the back wall judges me?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: The back wall is notoriously forgiving. Just speak clearly.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I tend to mumble when I'm nervous. Like a very quiet, scared squirrel.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Remember to smile! Even if it feels fake.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: A fake smile? I might look like I'm trying to sell something I don't believe in.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Just imagine everyone is wearing silly hats. It works for me!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Silly hats... Okay, I'll try it. Wish me luck, Alice.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good luck, Bob! Don't forget your imaginary hat-wearing audience!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Presentations are a very common part of school, university, and work life today. Whether you need to share information with classmates, colleagues, or clients, giving a presentation is a key skill. Many people feel nervous about public speaking, just like Bob in our dialogue. However, with practice and some simple techniques, you can improve a lot. Presentations help you share your ideas clearly, demonstrate your knowledge, and persuade others. Even if you start with "PowerPoint monster" fear, learning to present confidently is a valuable step in your English learning journey and in your career!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Simple Tense</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about habits, routines, general truths, and facts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Habits/Routines:</strong>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>I <strong>tend to mumble</strong> when I'm nervous.</em> (Bob's habit)</span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>It <strong>works</strong> for me!</em> (Alice's routine/strategy)</span></li>
        <li><strong>General Truths/Facts:</strong>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>The back wall <strong>is</strong> notoriously forgiving.</em> (A general observation)</span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>It <strong>helps</strong> with nerves.</em> (A general truth)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
        <strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + base form of verb (add '-s' or '-es' for he/she/it).<br>
        <em>I/You/We/They <strong>speak</strong>. He/She/It <strong>speaks</strong>.</em>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Imperative Verbs</h3>
    <p>We use imperative verbs to give commands, advice, or instructions. They often start with the base form of the verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advice/Instructions:</strong>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>Just <strong>speak</strong> clearly.</em></span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Remember</strong> to smile!</em></span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>Just <strong>imagine</strong> everyone is wearing silly hats.</em></span></li>
        <li><strong>Negative Imperative (Don't):</strong>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Don't forget</strong> your imaginary hat-wearing audience!</em></span></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
        The subject "you" is understood but not usually spoken.
    </div>

    <h3>3. The Verb "To be"</h3>
    <p>The verb "to be" is one of the most common and important verbs in English. It's used to describe states, identities, and conditions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Describing a state or condition:</strong>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>It'<strong>s</strong> presentation day tomorrow!</em> (It is)</span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>My slides <strong>are</strong> more confused than I am.</em></span>
            <span class="example-sentence"><em>It <strong>is</strong> worse than a ghost.</em></span></li>

            <span class="example-sentence"><em>What'<strong>s</strong> up?</em> (What is up?)</span></li>
