Alice : Bob, what’s that on your nose? Is that... a tiny piece of carrot? Bob : Oh, Alice! You saw it! I was just trying to balance it. It’s for my 'balancing-food-on-my-face' hobby. Alice : (laughs) Your nose is not a shelf, Bob! And why are your ears bright red? Bob : Ah, that’s because I just ran very fast. My legs are tired, too! Alice : You ran? From what? A talking carrot? Bob : No, from a very enthusiastic dog. He wanted my sandwich! I used my arms to hold it high. Alice : Smart! So your hands kept the sandwich safe. What about your feet? Did they hurt? Bob : A little. My toes are a bit squished from my shoes. And my knees feel wobbly. Alice : Maybe you should sit down. My head is starting to hurt just thinking about your adventure. Bob : Good idea. My back is a bit stiff from running hunched over, trying to hide. Alice : You used your eyes to watch the dog, right? Not your mouth? Bob : Of course, my eyes! My mouth was busy shouting, "No, sandwich! My sandwich!" Alice : (shakes her head) You always have the best stories, Bob. My stomach hurts from laughing. Bob : Well, I’m glad my adventure brought you joy. Now, about this carrot… *chomp* Alice : Bob! That was on your nose! Bob : Extra vitamins for my brain!
