Alice : Oh no, Bob! I completely forgot about the "Fluffy Unicorns" concert tickets! They go on sale *now*! Bob : Alice! You did?! I set an alarm! Let me see... I'm on the website! It's so slow! Alice : Mine too! It just says "Loading..." This is worse than trying to catch a greased pig! Bob : Okay, I see *some* tickets! But they're super expensive, like for VIPs with gold-plated seats! Alice : Gold-plated? Are we booking a rocket ship to the moon or a concert? Bob : Exactly! Wait, a new section just popped up! "Balcony View - Limited Availability." Alice : Quick, Bob, *book them*! Any view is better than no view! Bob : Clicking... clicking... Oh no, it's asking for a captcha. "Select all squares with traffic lights." This is a conspiracy! Alice : A conspiracy to make us miss Fluffy Unicorns! Hurry, I'm refreshing my page. It just went blank! Bob : I think I got through the captcha! Now it's asking for payment details. Alice : Use my card! It's in my purse. Wait, no, use yours, I don't trust the internet with my lucky number right now. Bob : Too late, I'm using mine! Oh, it says "Processing..." Alice : Did we get them? Please say yes! I've been practicing my air guitar for weeks! Bob : ...YES! Two tickets for the Fluffy Unicorns! Balcony View! We did it, Alice! Alice : Bob, you're a hero! Let's celebrate with... a practice air guitar concert!
