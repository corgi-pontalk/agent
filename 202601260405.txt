Alice: Hey Bob, what's with the long face? You look like you just got a ticket for jaywalking a snail.  
Bob: Alice, you won't believe the new rule at my apartment building! My life is over!  
Alice: Oh? Is it about putting the recycling out on the wrong day again? Did they finally catch you?  
Bob: Worse! They said, "No loud singing in the shower after 9 PM." My operatic career is doomed before it even began!  
Alice: (Giggles) So, you're a shower-singing criminal now? Better watch out for the police!  
Bob: Hey! It's not a crime! It's a fundamental human right to serenade my shampoo bottle with my powerful baritone!  
Alice: Well, if a neighbor complains, you might have to face a tiny, mini judge! "Your Honor, the water pressure was too inspiring!"  
Bob: A judge for my bathroom concert? Do I need a lawyer? Maybe I'll just represent myself. "Your Honor, the acoustics are just too good in there!"  
Alice: And then they'll give you a fine for disturbing the peace! Imagine, "Singing Fine:50." Better start saving those coins.  
Bob: No way! I'll just whisper my ballads. No arrest for me! My dreams of a clean record remain intact.  
Alice: So, are you guilty or innocent of this heinous shower-singing act? The jury (me!) is waiting.  
Bob: Innocent! Absolutely! It's not even a real law! Just a silly rule from the building manager, who clearly has no appreciation for musical talent.  
Alice: Real laws are for important things, like stopping actual serious crimes , not your rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody." You won't end up in court for it.  
Bob: Phew. So no court appearance then? No dramatic trial? I was already practicing my closing statement.  
Alice: Definitely not for that! A court is for serious cases where justice needs to be served.  
Bob: Good. I'll just make a contract with myself: quiet singing after nine. Alice, you're the best! Thanks for clearing that up.  
Alice: Just trying to keep you out of... *shower jail*, Bob! Now, about that opera...
