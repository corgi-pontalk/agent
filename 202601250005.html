    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, wait up! Is that... a tiny pineapple on your wrist?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! What's with the sudden sprint? And yes, keen eyes! It's my new, rather charming, fineline pineapple.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A fineline pineapple? You're really <em>embracing the global micro-tattoo trend</em>, aren't you? I thought you were more into the abstract geometric stuff.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I am! But sometimes you just need a whimsical fruit. Besides, someone has to <em>keep up with</em> the aesthetic demands of the fruit kingdom.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (Laughs) Fair enough. I've seen so many people <em>going for</em> botanical designs lately, too. And those tattoos that look like watercolor paintings? So pretty!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, watercolor is huge. And don't forget the surge in traditional styles with a modern twist. Like Japanese irezumi but with brighter, less conventional colors.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, absolutely! It's interesting how culturally specific designs are <em>getting global recognition</em>. Like tribal patterns from different regions.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Totally! But it also <em>sparks conversations</em> about cultural appropriation, which is super important to consider.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Definitely. And I heard some artists are even using vegan inks and sustainable practices now. Talk about eco-conscious body art!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Absolutely. The whole industry is evolving. From tiny fruit to full-back masterpieces, there's something for everyone, and it's getting more ethical too.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> So, what's next for you? A hyperrealistic avocado? Or a sleeve of ethically sourced bananas?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Let's just say my fruit bowl might eventually <em>migrate to</em> my skin. But for now, the pineapple <em>holds its reign</em>!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> As it should! Don't let the fruit power go to your head, Bob.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Never! But a man and his pineapple must stand united against boring skin.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You're something else, Bob. Something else.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The global tattoo and body art scene is experiencing a vibrant evolution, moving beyond traditional norms to embrace diverse styles, ethical considerations, and mainstream acceptance. Key trends include the surging popularity of **micro and fineline tattoos**, offering subtle yet intricate designs, often in minimalist or symbolic forms. **Abstract, geometric, and minimalist designs** continue to be favored for their modern aesthetic, while **botanical and nature-inspired themes** like delicate flowers, leaves, and animals remain timeless favorites.</p>
    <p>**Watercolor and illustrative styles** create unique, painterly effects, blurring the lines between tattoo and fine art. There's also a significant **revival of traditional styles** (e.g., Japanese irezumi, American traditional) often infused with contemporary colors or elements, giving them a fresh appeal. Furthermore, a growing appreciation for **culturally specific designs** from various indigenous traditions is noted, prompting important discussions around cultural exchange versus appropriation.</p>
    <p>Beyond aesthetics, the industry is increasingly focused on **sustainability and ethics**, with more artists adopting vegan inks, sustainable studio practices, and prioritizing client safety and consent. Tattoos are widely viewed as a form of personal expression and art, leading to their broader acceptance across different demographics and professions.</p>

                <strong>Present Continuous for Trends and Evolving Situations</strong><br>
                The Present Continuous tense (<em>am/is/are + verb-ing</em>) is frequently used to describe actions that are happening now, but also to talk about changing situations or trends that are ongoing.
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Phrasal Verbs</strong><br>
                Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that, together, create a new meaning different from the original verb. They are very common in informal English.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wait up!</strong> (verb + adverb): to delay for someone.</li>

                    <li><strong>Spark up</strong> (verb + adverb - *used as 'spark conversations'*): to start or initiate.</li>
                    <li><em>Usage Note:</em> The meaning of a phrasal verb is often idiomatic and cannot be guessed from the individual words.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quantifiers (So many / A little something)</strong><br>
                Quantifiers are words that are used to express quantity or amount.
