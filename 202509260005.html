    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, you won't believe what happened in my history class today!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, Alice, don't tell me Professor Davis tried interpretive dance again. My eyes still haven't recovered from last semester's "Renaissance Fair".</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Even better! We used VR headsets to visit ancient Rome. I almost got trampled by a virtual chariot while trying to take a selfie with a digital gladiator!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hold on, you're serious? VR in *history* class? I thought that was just for gaming, like fighting dragons or building pixelated worlds.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Nope! It was incredible. Way more engaging than just reading a textbook. I actually *saw* the Colosseum, and heard the crowds, without the hassle of a 10-hour flight.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Sounds like a game changer for sure. My physics class could really use that. Imagine doing experiments without accidentally blowing anything up. My last attempt involved a small fire alarm incident.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! And no more dissection frogs – virtual ones instead. Score! My biology grade might finally improve if I don't have to deal with the actual smell.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, you've got a point there. My biggest fear in bio was always slicing the wrong thing or, as you said, the smell. What about geography? Could you climb Mount Everest from your desk?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Totally! Plus, imagine learning about space. You could literally float among the planets and dodge asteroids, all while staying safely in your classroom chair.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> That's... mind-blowing. No more dusty planetarium trips where I always fall asleep halfway through. This sounds like the future, today.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Right? But then our virtual guide, a toga-clad Caesar, tripped over a pixelated cobblestone and his digital laurel wreath fell off. It was hilarious.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Haha! Even virtual emperors have their clumsy moments. So, is this just a one-off special event, or is it here to stay for actual lessons?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Our professor said they're rolling it out for a few more subjects next semester. I'm hoping for a VR trip to the Amazon rainforest next. I want to see a virtual jaguar!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Sounds like I need to switch majors, or at least strategically schedule some classes that use VR. Maybe I can convince my engineering prof to let us build virtual bridges.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Dream on, Bob! You'll have to get your own virtual toga if you want to join our Roman excursions. And don't forget your virtual selfie stick!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is quickly evolving from a niche gaming technology into a powerful educational tool. While still in its early stages of widespread adoption, VR offers immersive and interactive learning experiences that traditional methods often cannot replicate. Students can take virtual field trips to ancient civilizations, explore the human body from within, conduct complex science experiments in a safe, simulated environment, or practice hands-on skills like surgery or engineering in a risk-free setting.</p>
    <p>The benefits include increased engagement, better retention of information due to experiential learning, and accessibility to experiences that would otherwise be impossible or too costly. However, challenges such as the high cost of equipment, the need for specialized content development, potential technical glitches, and the risk of motion sickness are still factors. Despite these hurdles, many educators and institutions are experimenting with VR, recognizing its potential to revolutionize how we teach and learn.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>You won't believe what happened:</strong> An expression used to introduce surprising or exciting news.

    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Possibility and Advice (could, would)</h3>
    <p>Modal verbs like "could" and "would" are used to express possibility, ability, requests, or advice. In the dialogue, they are often used to talk about hypothetical situations or suggestions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Could:</strong> Expresses possibility or ability.
            <p class="example-sentence">My physics class <strong>could</strong> really use that. (It's possible it would be useful)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">You <strong>could</strong> literally float among the planets. (It would be possible to do this in VR)</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Would:</strong> Often used in conditional sentences to talk about hypothetical results or to express a polite request.
            <p class="example-sentence">It <strong>would</strong> be great if we had VR in all classes. (Hypothetical result)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Gerunds after Prepositions</h3>
    <p>A gerund is the -ing form of a verb that functions as a noun. After prepositions (like "without," "than," "of," "for"), you almost always use a gerund.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>without blowing anything up:</strong> Here, "blowing" is the gerund following the preposition "without."
            <p class="example-sentence">He managed to fix the computer <strong>without breaking</strong> anything else.</p></li>
        <li><strong>more engaging than just reading a textbook:</strong> "Reading" is the gerund following the preposition "than."
            <p class="example-sentence">Running is better exercise <strong>than just sitting</strong> on the couch.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Imagine doing experiments:</strong> Although "imagine" isn't a preposition, it's often followed by a gerund. Many verbs of perception or mental activity are followed by gerunds.
            <p class="example-sentence">I enjoy <strong>playing</strong> chess. (enjoy + gerund)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and an adverb or a preposition (or both) that, when combined, create a new meaning.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>blow up:</strong> To explode, or to inflate. In the dialogue, "accidentally blowing anything up" means causing an explosion.
            <p class="example-sentence">The old building was scheduled to <strong>blow up</strong> next week to make way for a new park.</p></li>
        <li><strong>hold on:</strong> To wait or pause; to grasp tightly. In the dialogue, it means "wait a moment."
            <p class="example-sentence">Can you <strong>hold on</strong> a minute while I grab my bag?</p></li>
        <li><strong>roll out:</strong> To officially introduce a new product or service.
            <p class="example-sentence">The company plans to <strong>roll out</strong> its new smartphone next month.</p></li>
        <li><strong>dream on:</strong> An informal expression meaning what someone desires is unlikely to happen.
            <p class="example-sentence">"I'm going to finish all my homework in an hour!" "<strong>Dream on</strong>, you've got three essays to write."</p></li>
    </ul>

However, challenges such as the high cost of equipment, the need for specialized content development, potential technical glitches, and the risk of motion sickness are still factors. Despite these hurdles, many educators and institutions are experimenting with VR, recognizing its potential to revolutionize how we teach and learn.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Possibility and Advice (could, would)</h3>
    <p>Modal verbs like "could" and "would" are used to express possibility, ability, requests, or advice. In the dialogue, they are often used to talk about hypothetical situations or suggestions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Could:</strong> Expresses possibility or ability.
            <p class="example-sentence">My physics class <strong>could</strong> really use that. (It's possible it would be useful)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">You <strong>could</strong> literally float among the planets. (It would be possible to do this in VR)</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Would:</strong> Often used in conditional sentences to talk about hypothetical results or to express a polite request.
            <p class="example-sentence">It <strong>would</strong> be great if we had VR in all classes. (Hypothetical result)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Gerunds after Prepositions</h3>
    <p>A gerund is the -ing form of a verb that functions as a noun. After prepositions (like "without," "than," "of," "for"), you almost always use a gerund.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>without blowing anything up:</strong> Here, "blowing" is the gerund following the preposition "without."
            <p class="example-sentence">He managed to fix the computer <strong>without breaking</strong> anything else.</p></li>
        <li><strong>more engaging than just reading a textbook:</strong> "Reading" is the gerund following the preposition "than."
            <p class="example-sentence">Running is better exercise <strong>than just sitting</strong> on the couch.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Imagine doing experiments:</strong> Although "imagine" isn't a preposition, it's often followed by a gerund. Many verbs of perception or mental activity are followed by gerunds.
            <p class="example-sentence">I enjoy <strong>playing</strong> chess. (enjoy + gerund)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and an adverb or a preposition (or both) that, when combined, create a new meaning.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>blow up:</strong> To explode, or to inflate. In the dialogue, "accidentally blowing anything up" means causing an explosion.
            <p class="example-sentence">The old building was scheduled to <strong>blow up</strong> next week to make way for a new park.</p></li>
        <li><strong>hold on:</strong> To wait or pause; to grasp tightly. In the dialogue, it means "wait a moment."
            <p class="example-sentence">Can you <strong>hold on</strong> a minute while I grab my bag?</p></li>
        <li><strong>roll out:</strong> To officially introduce a new product or service.
            <p class="example-sentence">The company plans to <strong>roll out</strong> its new smartphone next month.</p></li>
        <li><strong>dream on:</strong> An informal expression meaning what someone desires is unlikely to happen.
            <p class="example-sentence">"I'm going to finish all my homework in an hour!" "<strong>Dream on</strong>, you've got three essays to write."</p></li>
    </ul>
