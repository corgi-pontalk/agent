    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Ugh, Bob! This selfie is impossible!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: What's wrong, Alice? You look like you're fighting a small animal.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I'm trying to get a good profile picture for my social media. It needs to be 'aesthetic'!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Aesthetic? Just smile! Or use a filter. There's one that makes you look like a cat.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: No, Bob! Not a cat filter! I want to look cool and natural, but also slightly mysterious. And the lighting is all wrong.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Ah, the classic 'effortless but took three hours' look. Have you tried standing on one leg?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Don't be silly! Maybe I need a 'golden hour' shot. But it's noon.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Right. You need a 'magic hour' filter then. Or just post a picture of your food. Everyone loves food pics.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I already posted my avocado toast this morning. It only got two likes.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Two likes? Maybe your toast wasn't 'influencer-level' enough. Did you add a fancy hashtag?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I added #brunchlife. Isn't that enough?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: You need more! Try #foodie #yummy #toasttuesday... even if it's Wednesday. Hashtag everything!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: This is exhausting. Maybe I should just post a funny meme instead. They always get lots of shares.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Good idea! Or a picture of your cat. Cats always win the internet.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I don't have a cat, Bob. Fine, I'll just use a 'no filter' filter and hope for the best. Wish me luck!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Good luck, Alice! May your likes be plentiful!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Social media has become a huge part of our daily lives, and with it comes its own special way of speaking English! "Social media English" refers to the specific words, phrases, and slang used when interacting on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or X (formerly Twitter). It's often informal, uses abbreviations, and includes terms that describe actions or items unique to these online spaces.</p>
    <p>Understanding these terms is important because they are used not just online, but also in everyday conversations, especially among younger people. Knowing them helps you understand posts, comments, and even jokes. From taking a "selfie" to adding a "hashtag," these words are now common in the English language.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <p>For beginners, let's focus on three essential grammar points that appear frequently in everyday English and social media conversations:</p>

    <h3>1. Present Simple Tense</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about habits, routines, general truths, and things that happen regularly. It's perfect for describing how people use social media.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Subject + Base Verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it)</li>
        <li><em>Examples from dialogue</em>:
            <ul>
                <li>"I <strong>post</strong> my avocado toast." (Regular action)</li>
                <li>"Everyone <strong>loves</strong> food pics." (General truth)</li>
                <li>"They always <strong>get</strong> lots of shares." (Habit/Regular event)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Imperative Verbs</h3>
    <p>Imperative verbs are used to give commands, instructions, advice, or make requests. On social media, you often see them telling you what to do (or not to do!).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Base Verb (for positive commands) or Don't + Base Verb (for negative commands)</li>
        <li><em>Examples from dialogue</em>:
            <ul>
                <li>"Just <strong>smile</strong>!" (Command)</li>
                <li>"<strong>Use</strong> a filter." (Suggestion)</li>
                <li>"<strong>Don't be</strong> silly!" (Negative command/advice)</li>
                <li>"<strong>Wish</strong> me luck!" (Request)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Basic Questions (Yes/No and Wh-questions)</h3>
    <p>Asking questions is fundamental for communication. Beginners should practice simple Yes/No questions and basic "Wh-" questions (What, Where, Why, How).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes/No Questions</strong> (start with "Do/Does", "Is/Are", "Have/Has"):
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "<strong>Did you add</strong> a fancy hashtag?"</li>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "<strong>Isn't that</strong> enough?"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wh-Questions</strong> (start with "What", "Where", "Why", "How", etc.):
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "<strong>What's</strong> wrong, Alice?"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
