    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, you look like a kid on Christmas Eve. What's got you so buzzed?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, you *know* what it is! It's *the* New Glenn! I'm convinced this is the year, the month, maybe even the week!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, right. The rocket that's been "imminent" since I was in high school? Are we talking 'any day now' or 'next decade, probably'?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Don't be a cynic! Blue Origin officially announced it's targeting late 2024 for the maiden flight. That's *now*! Ish!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: "Targeting late 2024" means December 31st at 11:59 PM, if we're lucky, then delayed again. Remember when it was "early 2020s"?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Details, details! They've completed the BE-4 engine qualification. That's huge! It means *fireworks* are coming!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I'll believe it when I see it launch, not just a fancy render. Is Jeff Bezos personally polishing the nose cone?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: He might as well be! This is going to be a game-changer, Alice. A fully reusable heavy-lift rocket. Imagine the possibilities!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I *am* imagining. I'm imagining it sitting on the launchpad, gathering dust, while we wait for another "minor technical adjustment."</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You're just jealous you didn't invest in Blue Origin. This isn't just a rocket; it's an *experience*.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: An experience of eternal anticipation, you mean. So, have you booked your front-row seat for the livestream of the *announcement of the next delay*?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Very funny. But seriously, this flight is crucial for Blue Origin's future. They've got ULA relying on them for Vulcan Centaur, too.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: True, that's a big deal. They really need to get New Glenn flying reliably. It's not just about Bezos's space dreams anymore.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! And when it finally *does* fly, I expect a full apology from you for your lack of faith.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I'll buy you a space-themed ice cream if it launches *and* lands successfully this year. Deal?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Deal! But if it's delayed again, *you* owe *me* a year's supply of "I told you so" snacks.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha, fair enough. Now, let's just hope they don't find a squirrel living in the booster.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Blue Origin's New Glenn is a heavy-lift orbital launch vehicle designed to compete in the commercial space launch market. Named after astronaut John Glenn, it is intended to be a powerful and cost-effective rocket, primarily due to its fully reusable first stage, which will land back on a ship at sea.</p>
    <p>The maiden flight of New Glenn has experienced numerous delays since its initial announcement. While originally projected for the early 2020s, the launch has been pushed back several times. A significant milestone, the qualification of its BE-4 engines (which are also used in ULA's Vulcan Centaur rocket), has been completed. Currently, Blue Origin is targeting late 2024 for the inaugural flight of New Glenn. This flight is crucial for Blue Origin to secure its position in the competitive space launch industry and fulfill existing contracts.</p>
