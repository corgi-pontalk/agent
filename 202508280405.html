        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, hey Bob! I'm trying to write my self-introduction for my new online English class. It's so hard!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Self-introduction, Alice? For a <em>class</em>? Just say "Hi, I'm Alice, I like cats." Done.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> No, Bob! It needs to be professional. Listen: "My name is Alice. I am a student. I live in London. My hobbies are reading and quiet contemplation."</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> "Quiet contemplation"? Alice, are you secretly a wise old owl? That sounds like a sleepy robot.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's serious! What about you? How would <em>you</em> introduce yourself?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Me? Easy. "Hello, everyone! I'm Bob, the human tornado of fun! I love pizza, video games, and making Alice laugh."</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Human tornado"? Nobody will take you seriously! And you live in London, too, remember?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, yeah. But "I live in London" sounds so... plain. Maybe "My current location is a fantastic city known as London!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, it's for beginners. They need simple English! "I live in London" is perfect.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, okay. So, "My name is Alice. I am a student. I live in London. My hobbies are... what <em>are</em> your real hobbies, Alice? Not sleepy owl stuff."</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hmm. I like watching movies and baking cupcakes. And listening to pop music!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> See! Much better! "My hobbies are watching movies, baking cupcakes, and listening to pop music." Now add "Nice to meet you all!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> That sounds... much more like me! Thank you, Bob. "Nice to meet you all!"</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> You're welcome, Alice. Maybe I should be an introduction consultant. For a small fee, of course.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (laughs) Oh, Bob! You're silly. But my introduction is ready now!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>"Self-introduction" is one of the very first things you learn when starting to speak a new language. It's how you tell people who you are and helps you start conversations. Whether you're joining a new English class, meeting new friends from different countries, or even starting an online group, knowing how to introduce yourself clearly and confidently is a fundamental skill. It's not just about sharing facts; it's about making a good first impression and opening the door to further communication. Don't worry if it feels a little awkward at first â€“ everyone starts there!</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <h3>1. The Verb "To Be" (am, is, are)</h3>
            <p>This verb is super important for telling people who you are, what you are, and where you are. It changes form based on the subject.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I am:</strong> Used with "I". (e.g., <em>I am Alice. I am a student.</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>You are:</strong> Used with "you". (e.g., <em>You are my friend.</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>He/She/It is:</strong> Used with "he", "she", "it", or singular nouns. (e.g., <em>He is Bob. She is happy.</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>We are:</strong> Used with "we". (e.g., <em>We are friends.</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>They are:</strong> Used with "they" or plural nouns. (e.g., <em>They are students.</em>)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <h3>2. Subject Pronouns</h3>
            <p>These words replace nouns as the subject of a sentence. In self-introductions, "I" is key.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I:</strong> Refers to yourself. (e.g., <em>I live in London.</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>You:</strong> Refers to the person you are talking to.</li>
                <li><strong>He/She/It/We/They:</strong> (Other subject pronouns you will learn soon!)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <h3>3. Possessive Adjective "My"</h3>
            <p>This word shows that something belongs to "I".</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>My:</strong> (e.g., <em>My name is Alice. My hobbies are reading.</em>)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <h3>4. Simple Present Tense for Facts and Habits</h3>
            <p>When you talk about things that are always true or happen regularly, you use the simple present tense.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I live in London.</strong> (This is a fact about where you live.)</li>
                <li><strong>I like pizza.</strong> (This is a general preference.)</li>
                <li>Form: Subject + Base form of verb (for I/you/we/they). (e.g., <em>I watch movies. You bake cupcakes.</em>)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
