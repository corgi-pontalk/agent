Alice: Hey Bob, guess what I just saw?
Bob: What's up, Alice? You look like you've discovered a new flavor of ice cream.
Alice: Even better! They're already talking about the UN General Assembly 2025 highlights!
Bob: *The* UN General Assembly? 2025? Are we already time-traveling through news cycles?
Alice: I know, right? It feels like they're pre-announcing the Oscar winners for diplomacy.
Bob: "And the award for Most Vague but Hopeful Resolution goes to..."
Alice: Exactly! I mean, what even *are* the "highlights" for that kind of event? "World leaders politely agree to disagree"?
Bob: Probably a really long speech about climate change, followed by another really long speech about global peace, both delivered by someone who looks like they haven't slept in a week.
Alice: Don't forget the dramatic handshake photo-op! That's always a big one. They'll probably have a "Top 10 Handshakes of UNGA 2025" list.
Bob: I'd click that. Especially if there's a surprise fist bump or an awkward air kiss involved.
Alice: Haha! Or the moment someone accidentally spills coffee on a crucial document. Now *that* would be a highlight.
Bob: Or a surprise pop concert by a delegation member. Imagine President X dropping a beat!
Alice: Okay, now you're just making me want to actually watch it. Just for the potential chaos.
Bob: See? They're clearly trying to build hype. "UNGA 2025: This time, it's personal...ly tedious!"
Alice: You've got a point. But I guess it's good they're planning ahead for such important discussions, even if we joke about it.
