        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, you look like you've just seen a ghost, or maybe just spilled your coffee on a nuclear reactor blueprint.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Close, but it's worse. I've been reading about this 'nuclear energy comeback' debate, and my brain is fissioning.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Fissioning, huh? Sounds dramatic. What's got your protons in a twist?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, on one hand, 'clean energy!' On the other, 'radioactive waste that lasts longer than most civilizations!' It's a bit of a pickle.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> True, but think of the sheer power! And no more relying on fossil fuels, which, let's be honest, are just ancient dinosaur juice. Plus, no carbon emissions during operation. Climate change, anyone?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Ah, 'during operation' is the key phrase. What about Chernobyl? Or Fukushima? One oopsie and suddenly a whole region is glow-in-the-dark for centuries. My pet hamster wouldn't stand a chance.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, those were older designs! Modern reactors are supposedly much safer, practically foolproof. They have more safety protocols than my mom trying to organize her spice rack.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Foolproof, you say? Because humans are never foolish, right? I once tried to microwave a metal spoon. 'Foolproof' is a strong word when we're talking about something that can create a mini-sun.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> But imagine the energy density! A tiny pellet can power a whole city for ages. It's like a superpower for electricity generation, without the cape.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Sure, if you don't mind waiting 20 years and spending enough money to buy a small country just to build one plant. Solar panels and wind turbines pop up much faster, and don't require armed guards.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ah, but solar and wind are intermittent. The sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. Nuclear is constant, a steady hum of pure power. No more 'is it cloudy?' anxiety.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Constant until you have to store the radioactive leftovers for ten thousand years. We're talking about burying stuff that's still dangerous when future humans are living on Mars and communicating telepathically.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Maybe by then, they'll have developed a 'waste-eating' alien bacteria, or just launch it into the sun. Problem solved!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Right. Or it'll just sit there, silently glowing, waiting for some unsuspecting archaeologist to dig it up and accidentally awaken a radioactive zombie apocalypse. My money's on the zombie apocalypse.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> So, basically, we want clean energy, but without the 'meltdown and radioactive glow' parts. It's a tricky balance, isn't it? Like trying to adopt a pet dragon – powerful, but high maintenance.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Exactly! I think I'll stick to generating energy by frantically pedaling a bicycle. Less efficient, but significantly lower risk of turning my neighborhood into a fallout shelter.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The debate around nuclear energy has seen a significant resurgence globally. For decades, following major incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima, public sentiment and investment in nuclear power dwindled in many parts of the world. However, with the escalating climate crisis demanding urgent decarbonization, and recent geopolitical events highlighting the need for energy security, nuclear energy is being re-evaluated as a viable option.</p>
        <p>Proponents highlight its capacity for large-scale, continuous, and carbon-free electricity generation, emphasizing advancements in reactor safety and the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). Critics, however, remain concerned about the high upfront costs, lengthy construction times, the unresolved issue of long-term radioactive waste storage, and the potential for catastrophic accidents, even with modern designs. Countries like France, China, and the US are investing heavily, while others remain hesitant, underscoring the complex challenges and diverse perspectives on nuclear energy's role in a sustainable future.</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Comparatives and Superlatives</strong>: Used to compare things.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comparatives</strong> compare two things (e.g., *safer*, *longer*, *worse*, *faster*, *less efficient*, *significantly lower*).
                        <br>Example: "Modern reactors are <span class="example-sentence">much safer</span> than older designs."</li>
                    <li><strong>Superlatives</strong> compare three or more things and show which is the most or least (e.g., *the safest*, *the longest*).
                        <br>Example: "This is <span class="example-sentence">the most efficient</span> method."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Conditional Sentences (Type 1)</strong>: Used to express real or very likely situations in the future.
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure: <span class="key-phrase">If + simple present, will + base verb</span>.
                        <br>Example from dialogue: "If you don't mind waiting..." (Implied: you will get a plant).
                        <br>Another example: "<span class="example-sentence">If the sun doesn't shine, solar panels won't generate electricity.</span>"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Idioms and Figurative Language</strong>: These add humor, vividness, and expressiveness to language.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Idioms</strong> are phrases whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary meaning of its words (e.g., "<span class="key-phrase">a bit of a pickle</span>").</li>
                    <li><strong>Figurative language</strong> uses words or expressions with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation (e.g., metaphors, similes).
                        <br>Examples from dialogue: "<span class="key-phrase">my brain is fissioning</span>" (metaphor for extreme mental activity), "<span class="key-phrase">put your protons in a twist</span>" (idiomatic, humorous way of saying "get upset"), "<span class="key-phrase">ancient dinosaur juice</span>" (metaphor for fossil fuels), "like trying to adopt a <span class="key-phrase">pet dragon – powerful, but high maintenance</span>" (simile).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
