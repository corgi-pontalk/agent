Alice: Oh, Bob, hi! What are you doing with that funny noise?
Bob: Alice! Perfect timing! I'm practicing my animal sounds for a party game. Listen, what animal is this? _Mooooo!_
Alice: Haha! That's a cow, for sure! But your "moo" sounds like a sad trombone.
Bob: A sad trombone-cow! I'll take it! Okay, try this one: _Woof woof!_
Alice: Easy peasy! A dog! Do you have a dog, Bob?
Bob: Not yet, but I want one! A big, friendly dog. How about this? _Meow!_
Alice: A cat! I love cats. They are so cute and sleepy.
Bob: They are! Okay, next! _Screech, screech!_ *Swings arms like wings.*
Alice: Hmm, a bird? Or maybe a very angry parrot?
Bob: A parrot! Good job! They can talk, you know.
Alice: Yes, my aunt has one that says "Hello handsome!" to everyone.
Bob: Hilarious! Last one. This is tricky. _Oink oink!_
Alice: Oh, Bob! Is that a pig? You sound just like one rolling in mud!
Bob: Mission accomplished! I *felt* like a pig rolling in mud. Do you like pigs, Alice?
Alice: They're funny! But I prefer fluffy animals, like rabbits.
Bob: Rabbits are cute! I saw one hop yesterday.
Alice: So, are you ready for your party game now, Bob?
Bob: Almost! Just need to work on my _ribbit ribbit_ for a frog.
