Alice : Bob, what are you doing with that big camera?   Bob : Oh, Alice! Perfect timing! I'm a journalist today.   Alice : A journalist? Really? What's your big story?   Bob : Breaking news! A pigeon is trying to open the bakery door!   Alice : *chuckles* A pigeon? That's your scoop?   Bob : Yes! It's a gripping tale of urban wildlife and forbidden pastries. I need to get the facts straight.   Alice : Did you interview the pigeon? Or the baker?   Bob : Not yet! I'm observing its methods. This could be a new trend! 'Pigeons Gone Wild!'   Alice : Hmm. Sounds like important _local news_. Are you writing an article?   Bob : Of course! I'm gathering all the _information_. I'll write a _report_ later. Maybe even get it on the _evening news_!   Alice : The evening news for a pigeon? You're funny, Bob. Don't forget to check your _sources_!   Bob : My source is the pigeon itself, Alice! Very reliable. It's an _investigative report_!   Alice : Well, good luck, _reporter_ Bob. Let me know if the pigeon gets a croissant.   Bob : Will do! This _story_ is going to be huge!   Alice : I'm sure it will be. Keep me updated!
