Alice: Bob, I swear, trying to figure out what to order for dinner is harder than the Middle East peace negotiations!
Bob: Alice, tell me about it! At least with the Middle East, there are experts. For dinner, it's just us and our indecisiveness.
Alice: Right? I feel like we've reached a permanent _stalemate_ on pizza vs. tacos. It's like a tiny, culinary version of the geopolitical deadlock.
Bob: Exactly! Every time we think we're close to a _breakthrough_ , someone brings up falafel, and we're back to square one.
Alice: If only there was a simple _roadmap to peace_ for our stomachs. Maybe a UN resolution for takeout?
Bob: Haha, a _two-state solution_ where one night is pizza and the next is tacos? But then what about the "third state" of pasta?
Alice: See? This is why it's so complicated! There are too many _sticking points_. Like, what about toppings? Pineapple on pizza is a non-starter for me.
Bob: Oh, that's a whole other negotiation! Some things are just not _on the table_ , I agree.
Alice: I wonder if the real peace negotiators ever just throw up their hands and order Chinese food for everyone.
Bob: Probably! Or they have their own internal debates about whether it should be General Tso's or sweet and sour chicken. The struggle is universal.
Alice: So, if you were a diplomat, what would be your grand strategy for our dinner crisis? A long-term peace plan?
Bob: Hmm, I'd propose a rotational system, with binding arbitration for dessert. And no unilateral declarations of "I'm not hungry!"
Alice: That sounds surprisingly robust! Maybe you should offer your services to the actual peace talks. They could use someone who understands the complexity of multiple, deeply held desires.
Bob: Perhaps I will! But first, let's solve our dinner dilemma. Pizza or tacos, Alice? We need a decision before global hunger sets in.
Alice: Okay, okay! Let's go for... a compromise. Indian! No one ever argues about Indian food.
