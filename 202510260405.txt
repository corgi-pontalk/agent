Alice : Hi, Bob! You look so happy! What's up? Bob : Alice! Hey! I just came back from the most amazing hike. The mountains were incredible! Alice : Oh, really? Tell me more. Was it beautiful? Bob : Beautiful? Alice, it was majestic! The trees were so tall, like giants reaching for the sky. Alice : Wow, giants? Sounds a bit dramatic, Bob. Bob : No, seriously! And the river! It was crystal clear , sparkling in the sun like a million tiny diamonds. Alice : Diamonds? You must have been very thirsty to see diamonds in the water! Bob : Haha, maybe! But the air was so fresh and clean. I felt like I could breathe for the first time in ages. Alice : That sounds nice. I love fresh air. Were there any animals? Bob : Oh, yes! I saw a little squirrel. It was so fluffy and quick , darting up a tree. Alice : A fluffy squirrel! Did it have a tiny backpack? Bob : No, Alice, but it looked very busy! And the flowers! So many colors â€“ red, yellow, purple... a carpet of flowers! Alice : A carpet? So you could lie down on them? Bob : Well, not exactly! But it felt like it. The whole place was so peaceful. No city noise, just birds singing. Alice : Birds singing... or perhaps a squirrel trying to rap? Bob : You're funny! But you should go. It's truly a wonderful place to see nature. Alice : Maybe I will, especially if I can find those water diamonds! Bob : You'll have to find them yourself!
