            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, it's Alice! Did I wake you up? It's 10 AM!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Uh, Alice? No, no, just... contemplating the ceiling. What's up?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I'm just calling to ask... what's your favorite type of cheese? It's important.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> My *favorite type of cheese*? You called me for cheese? I thought it was an emergency!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It *is* an emergency! I'm making a sandwich, and I need expert advice.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, okay. For sandwiches, definitely cheddar. Sharp cheddar.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ooh, good choice! My phone was almost dead, so I called before it died completely.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Smart move. So, you're making a cheese sandwich? Just cheese?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> And a little mustard! Are you busy? Or still contemplating the ceiling?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I was about to call you, actually. To ask if you wanted to watch a movie later.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> What a coincidence! We're practically telepathic, Bob!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Or you just have excellent timing. Anyway, what movie do you want to see?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Let me think... I'll call you back in five minutes with an idea. My battery is at 1%!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh no! Quick! Before it dies! Don't forget the sharp cheddar!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, never! Talk soon, Bob! *beep*</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>In today's world, talking on the phone is still a very common way to communicate, especially for personal conversations, urgent matters, or when you want to hear someone's voice. While messaging apps and video calls are popular, a simple voice call remains essential. People use phones for work, to chat with friends and family, or to get help quickly. Knowing how to start and end a call, and how to express yourself clearly, is a very useful skill in English.</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Present Continuous (e.g., "I'm calling")</h3>
        <p>We use the Present Continuous tense for actions happening <span class="grammar-point">right now</span>, or around this time. The structure is:</p>
        <p><code>Subject + am/is/are + verb-ing</code></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="example-sentence">"I <strong>am calling</strong>." (I'm calling)</span></li>
            <li><span class="example-sentence">"She <strong>is making</strong> a sandwich." (She's making)</span></li>
            <li><span class="example-sentence">"They <strong>are watching</strong> a movie." (They're watching)</span></li>
            <li>To ask a question: <span class="example-sentence">"<strong>Are you busy</strong>?"</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Wh-Questions (e.g., "What's up?")</h3>
        <p>We use Wh-questions to ask for specific information. Common Wh-words are: <strong>What, Where, When, Who, Why, How</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">What</span> (for things, ideas): <span class="example-sentence">"<strong>What's</strong> your favorite type of cheese?"</span></li>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">Where</span> (for places): <span class="example-sentence">"<strong>Where</strong> are you going?"</span></li>
            <li><span class="grammar-point">Who</span> (for people): <span class="example-sentence">"<strong>Who</strong> is that?"</span></li>
        </ul>
