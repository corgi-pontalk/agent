Alice : Hey Bob, what's up? You look like you're plotting something big! Bob : Oh, hi Alice! Just thinking about my next big startup idea. I want to be a successful founder! Alice : Oh really? Another one? Is this the "app that orders pizza for your cat" idea again? Bob : Haha, no! This time it's serious. It's an app for finding lost socks. Imagine, no more single socks! Alice : (Laughs) That's... certainly an idea! How will it work? Bob : Well, users upload a picture of their lonely sock. The app uses AI to match it with its missing partner. I need to build a prototype first. Alice : Interesting. And who would invest in that? You'd need a lot of funding to make it happen. Bob : That's where my "pitch " comes in! I'll tell potential investors it's about solving a global laundry crisis. Think of the emotional toll of mismatched socks! Alice : You always have such a unique perspective. But seriously, getting seed funding can be tough. Bob : I know, I know. But if I can build a working prototype , I can show them it's possible. Maybe I'll start with just white socks. Keep it simple! Alice : Good strategy! Small steps. So, what's the company name for "The Sock Finder"? Bob : I'm thinking... "Sock-It-To-Me!" Or maybe "SoleMate." What do you think? Alice : "SoleMate" has potential! Just make sure your startup has a clear plan, not just a catchy name. Bob : You're right. First, the prototype. Then, I'll practice my pitch. Wish me luck! Alice : Good luck, Bob! Let me know when you're rich and can buy me a lifetime supply of matched socks!
