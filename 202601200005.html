        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, is that you or a ghost of last year's festival attendee? You look like you've seen a bass drop!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! You caught me. I was just staring blankly at my laptop, trying to decide if my bank account can handle my spirit's desire for live music.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ah, the annual dilemma! But seriously, have you seen how many festivals are back on the cards? It's like a musical zombie apocalypse, but with glitter!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I know, right? My feed is just bombarded with lineup announcements. My head's spinning faster than a DJ's turntable.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I'm already envisioning myself covered in questionable mud, singing off-key to my favorite band, and eating a surprisingly gourmet hotdog.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Don't forget the inevitable "festival flu" you'll catch. Last year I swear I came home with a new species of cough.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> A small price to pay for pure sonic bliss, my friend! Besides, they're everywhere now! From Glastonbury to Tomorrowland, it's a global party!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> True. I saw tickets for that new indie festival in the desert just went on sale. Desert, Alice! Imagine the dust, the heat, the sheer commitment!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Sounds epic! Think of the Instagram stories! I'm already mentally packing my neon fanny pack and biodegradable glitter.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> You're incorrigible. I'm more of a 'sit-in-a-camping-chair-and-people-watch' kind of festival-goer these days. My moshing days are behind me.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Nonsense! You're only as old as your last headbang! We need to plan something. My soul needs to be cleansed by loud, slightly out-of-tune music.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, okay, you've convinced me. Sort of. But if we go, I'm bringing industrial-strength earplugs and my own pillow. No more sleeping on a deflated air mattress for me.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Deal! And I'll bring the emergency glitter. You never know when you'll need to add a bit of sparkle to a muddy situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Sounds like a plan. Just don't let me try to crowdsurf again. My chiropractor still brings it up.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (Laughing) Wouldn't dream of it, Bob! This year, we're conquering the festivals, one gourmet hotdog at a time!</p>
