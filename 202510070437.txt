Bob: Hey Alice, guess what incredibly expensive new hobby I've decided to pursue?
Alice: Oh, hey Bob! What's got you so excited this time? Please tell me it's not artisanal squirrel juggling again.
Bob: Even better! I'm talking about private space tourism! It's absolutely booming right now.
Alice: Right, and my pet goldfish is training to be an astronaut. Who exactly is "booming" into space, Bob? Billionaires with too much time on their hands?
Bob: Well, yes, for now. But companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic are making it more accessible. They say prices are actually dropping!
Alice: "Dropping" to what? A price where I only have to sell one kidney instead of two? I heard a seat could still break the bank, like, seriously break it.
Bob: Okay, maybe not 'our' level just yet. But imagine a future where space hotels are a thing! Zero-gravity breakfast, anyone?
Alice: A space hotel? So I could complain about the in-flight meal literally out of this world? That does sound... uniquely annoying.
Bob: Annoying? It would be incredible! Think of the views, Alice! Earth as a tiny blue marble. No light pollution, just endless stars.
Alice: Okay, I admit, the views would be spectacular. But what about all the training? And the G-forces? My stomach barely handles a roller coaster.
Bob: Minor details! They're developing smoother rides. I'd pack extra ginger chews. Imagine the ultimate selfie, floating next to a window!
Alice: You're dreaming bigger than my last lottery ticket, Bob. But I suppose if it means escaping Earth's internet for a bit, maybe it has its perks.
Bob: Exactly! It's not just for science anymore. It's about adventure and experiencing something utterly unique. The market is definitely growing.
Alice: Alright, you've almost got me convinced, if only for the bragging rights. If *you* ever go, you absolutely have to bring me back a moon rock.
Bob: Deal! Now, how do we get a million dollars by next Tuesday?
