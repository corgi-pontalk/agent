Alice: Bob! Finally! I thought they'd kept you forever. Did you tell them your life story?
Bob: Alice, you wouldn't believe it! That immigration officer asked me the _weirdest_ question.
Alice: Oh no, what was it? Did he ask if you're secretly a pop star?
Bob: He asked, "What is the purpose of your visit?"
Alice: (Giggles) That's a normal question, Bob! They always ask that.
Bob: But then he looked at my passport photo and my face, and asked, "Is that _really_ you?"
Alice: (Laughs harder) Oh, poor Bob! Your passport photo is prettyâ€¦ adventurous, let's say.
Bob: It is! I told him, "Yes, it's me, just... before coffee."
Alice: Did he laugh?
Bob: He just stared. And then asked, "How long will you be staying?"
Alice: And you said... "Forever, if the food is good?"
Bob: I said, "Two weeks, exploring all the delicious food!" He seemed to like that answer, thankfully.
Alice: Good save! My officer was super quick. "Passport, please. Purpose of visit? Enjoy your stay!" Done!
Bob: Lucky you. I think I need a new passport photo... and a coffee. Let's get out of here.
Alice: Definitely! Come on, let's find our bags and some breakfast.
