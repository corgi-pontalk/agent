Alice : Hey Bob, you look like you just fought a bear! What happened? Bob : Oh, hi Alice. No bear, just my secret hobby. I was up late. Alice : Secret hobby? Tell me, tell me! Are you secretly a superhero? Bob : Even better! I'm a professional competitive napper. It's a lot of practice. Alice : (Laughing) A competitive napper? Bob, you're hilarious! How do you even compete? Bob : Well, it's about speed and quality of sleep. And finding the most unusual places to nap. My current record is on a unicycle. Alice : Wow, that's... unique! My hobby is a bit more traditional. I love collecting miniature rubber ducks. Bob : Rubber ducks? Alice, that's adorable! Do they have tiny little hats? Alice : Some do! I have a pirate duck and a doctor duck. They're very serious about their roles. Bob : I bet they are. So, you nap on unicycles, I collect tiny ducks. We're quite the pair, aren't we? Alice : Absolutely! But at least we both have something fun to do. Bob : True! Though I think my napping might actually _be_ part of a bear fight. I'm still tired. Alice : Maybe you need a nap after your nap practice? Bob : Exactly! It's a vicious cycle. Alice : Well, good luck with your next unicycle nap, Bob! Bob : Thanks, Alice! You too with your duck army!
