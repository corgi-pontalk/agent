        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p>Alice: Bob, did you see that article about the latest proposed regulations for autonomous cars? It's a complete mess!</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, Alice, you mean the one suggesting a mandatory "human panic button" and a speed limit of 30 mph? I nearly choked on my coffee! What's the point of autonomy then?</p>
        <p>Alice: Exactly! It's like they want self-driving cars to exist, but only if they're perpetually stuck in a school zone. The debate around liability is insane, too.</p>
        <p>Bob: Totally. If my driverless taxi crashes, who pays? The software company, the car manufacturer, or the guy who briefly had his hand *near* the steering wheel five minutes before?</p>
        <p>Alice: Good point! And what about the ethical dilemmas? Imagine a car having to choose between hitting a pedestrian or swerving into a tree, potentially harming its passenger. Who programs that decision?</p>
        <p>Bob: That's the "trolley problem" on wheels, isn't it? I heard some countries are leaning towards prioritizing the occupants, which makes sense from a consumer adoption perspective.</p>
        <p>Alice: But then it's basically saying, "Sorry, pedestrians, you're the expendable ones." That's a PR nightmare waiting to happen. The regulations need to be crystal clear on these ethical algorithms.</p>
        <p>Bob: Agreed. Though, honestly, I just want my car to drive me home after a long day without me having to remember where I parked. Is that too much to ask?</p>
        <p>Alice: Not at all, Bob, but there's a huge gap between "convenience" and "fail-safe operation across all scenarios." The testing standards are also a huge hurdle.</p>
        <p>Bob: Yeah, I saw a statistic that said autonomous cars would need to drive billions of miles to prove they're safer than human drivers. That's a lot of virtual roads!</p>
        <p>Alice: And real roads! Plus, who regulates the software updates? A new patch could introduce a bug that wasn't present during initial certification. It's a continuous regulatory challenge.</p>
        <p>Bob: You're making me think I should just stick to my bicycle. At least then I know who's to blame if I crash – me, usually!</p>
        <p>Alice: Well, at least your bicycle doesn't get confused by a plastic bag blowing across the road and slam on the brakes in rush hour traffic. That actually happened to someone I know.</p>
        <p>Bob: Okay, you've convinced me that the "Wild West" of autonomous car regulation needs a sheriff. A very smart, very quick-thinking sheriff.</p>
        <p>Alice: And a whole team of lawyers to write the fine print. It's going to be fascinating to watch this unfold, but I wouldn't bet on fully autonomous cars being commonplace anytime soon.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The global landscape for autonomous vehicle (AV) regulation is complex and highly fragmented. While many countries recognize the potential benefits of AVs in terms of safety, efficiency, and accessibility, there is no universally adopted legal framework. Different jurisdictions are taking varying approaches, leading to a patchwork of laws. Some regions, like parts of the US and Europe, have established frameworks for testing AVs on public roads, often requiring a human safety driver. The debate primarily revolves around:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safety Standards:</strong> How to prove an AV is safer than a human driver and what level of risk is acceptable.</li>
        <li><strong>Liability:</strong> Who is responsible in the event of an accident – the owner, the manufacturer, the software provider, or the deployer?</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Dilemmas:</strong> How AVs should be programmed to make decisions in unavoidable accident scenarios (e.g., the "trolley problem").</li>
        <li><strong>Data Privacy and Security:</strong> Protecting sensitive user data and preventing cyber-attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Design Domains (ODDs):</strong> Defining the specific conditions (weather, speed, road type) under which an AV is designed to operate safely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The lack of harmonized regulations poses challenges for manufacturers seeking to deploy AVs globally and for consumers trying to understand their rights and responsibilities.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Speculation and Obligation</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "A new patch <strong>could</strong> introduce a bug..." (expresses a possibility)</li>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "...who <strong>should</strong> be held responsible?" (expresses an expectation or suggested course of action)</li>
