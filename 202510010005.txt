Alice: Hey Bob, you look like a kid on Christmas Eve. What's got you so buzzed?
Bob: Alice, you *know* what it is! It's *the* New Glenn! I'm convinced this is the year, the month, maybe even the week!
Alice: Oh, right. The rocket that's been "imminent" since I was in high school? Are we talking 'any day now' or 'next decade, probably'?
Bob: Don't be a cynic! Blue Origin officially announced it's targeting late 2024 for the maiden flight. That's *now*! Ish!
Alice: "Targeting late 2024" means December 31st at 11:59 PM, if we're lucky, then delayed again. Remember when it was "early 2020s"?
Bob: Details, details! They've completed the BE-4 engine qualification. That's huge! It means *fireworks* are coming!
Alice: I'll believe it when I see it launch, not just a fancy render. Is Jeff Bezos personally polishing the nose cone?
Bob: He might as well be! This is going to be a game-changer, Alice. A fully reusable heavy-lift rocket. Imagine the possibilities!
Alice: I *am* imagining. I'm imagining it sitting on the launchpad, gathering dust, while we wait for another "minor technical adjustment."
Bob: You're just jealous you didn't invest in Blue Origin. This isn't just a rocket; it's an *experience*.
Alice: An experience of eternal anticipation, you mean. So, have you booked your front-row seat for the livestream of the *announcement of the next delay*?
Bob: Very funny. But seriously, this flight is crucial for Blue Origin's future. They've got ULA relying on them for Vulcan Centaur, too.
Alice: True, that's a big deal. They really need to get New Glenn flying reliably. It's not just about Bezos's space dreams anymore.
Bob: Exactly! And when it finally *does* fly, I expect a full apology from you for your lack of faith.
Alice: I'll buy you a space-themed ice cream if it launches *and* lands successfully this year. Deal?
Bob: Deal! But if it's delayed again, *you* owe *me* a year's supply of "I told you so" snacks.
Alice: Haha, fair enough. Now, let's just hope they don't find a squirrel living in the booster.
