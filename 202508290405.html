        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, guess what just happened with my brother!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh Alice, tell me, is he trying to teach a cat to fetch again?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Worse! My sister just tried to dye my dog pink!</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Wow, your family sounds wild! My mom would freak out if I did that.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Mine too! My dad just sighed and said, 'Not again, kids.'</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Haha! My dad once tried to cook Thanksgiving dinner. Let's just say we ordered pizza.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: That sounds familiar! My grandma is an amazing cook, but my grandpa only makes toast.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Lucky! My grandparents live far away, but they send the best cookies.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Aww! My aunt sends me funny postcards from her travels.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Cool! My uncle collects rubber ducks. Seriously, he has hundreds.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A rubber duck uncle? That's amazing! So, I have a pink-dog-dyeing sister, a crazy brother, a sighing dad, and a cooking-queen grandma.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: And I have a freak-out mom, a pizza-ordering dad, cookie-sending grandparents, and a duck-collecting uncle.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Our families are... unique.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Definitely! But I wouldn't trade them for anything.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Me neither! Even the pink-dog-dyeing part.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Good to know! Just don't let them near my cat.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Family members are the people who are part of your immediate or extended family. They are often the most important people in our lives. Learning their names in English helps you talk about your personal life and understand others when they talk about theirs. Families can be big or small, and every family is unique!</p>
        <p>Here are some common family members you'll often talk about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mother / Mom</strong>: Your female parent.</li>
            <li><strong>Father / Dad</strong>: Your male parent.</li>
            <li><strong>Parents</strong>: Your mother and father.</li>
            <li><strong>Brother</strong>: A male child of your parents.</li>
            <li><strong>Sister</strong>: A female child of your parents.</li>
            <li><strong>Siblings</strong>: Your brothers and sisters.</li>
            <li><strong>Grandmother / Grandma</strong>: The mother of your mother or father.</li>
            <li><strong>Grandfather / Grandpa</strong>: The father of your mother or father.</li>
            <li><strong>Grandparents</strong>: Your grandmother and grandfather.</li>
            <li><strong>Aunt</strong>: The sister of your mother or father, or your uncle's wife.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncle</strong>: The brother of your mother or father, or your aunt's husband.</li>
            <li><strong>Cousin</strong>: The child of your aunt or uncle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Possessive Adjectives: My, Your, His, Her</h3>
        <p>Possessive adjectives show who something belongs to. They always come *before* the noun (person or thing).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>My</strong>: belongs to me.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: <strong>My</strong> brother is tall.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Your</strong>: belongs to you.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: Is that <strong>your</strong> sister?</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>His</strong>: belongs to him (a male person).
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: <strong>His</strong> mom is a doctor.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Her</strong>: belongs to her (a female person).
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: <strong>Her</strong> dad drives a red car.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. The Verb "To Be" (is, are) for Description</h3>
        <p>We use "is" and "are" to describe people or things, or to state what they are. This is one of the most common verbs in English!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>is</strong>: used with singular nouns (he, she, it, my mom, the dog).
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: My dad <strong>is</strong> funny. She <strong>is</strong> my aunt.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>are</strong>: used with plural nouns (we, you, they, my parents, the kids).
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: My grandparents <strong>are</strong> old. We <strong>are</strong> happy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. The Verb "To Have" (have, has) for Possession</h3>
        <p>We use "have" and "has" to talk about owning something, or in this case, having a family member.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>have</strong>: used with I, you, we, they, and plural nouns.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: I <strong>have</strong> two sisters. They <strong>have</strong> a big family.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>has</strong>: used with he, she, it, and singular nouns.
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: He <strong>has</strong> an uncle who lives in New York. She <strong>has</strong> a pet dog.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
