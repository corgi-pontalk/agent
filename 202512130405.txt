Alice: Hey Bob, what do you think of my new outfit? I call it "Cloudy with a chance of sparkles!"
Bob: Alice! Wow, that's... certainly _you_. Is that a rainbow scarf with polka-dot pants?
Alice: It is! And these are my new astronaut boots. Very practical for walking on clouds, you know.
Bob: I can imagine. You always have such unique fashion sense. My style is more "comfy couch potato."
Alice: Come on, Bob! You look great in your simple t-shirts and jeans. It's classic!
Bob: Thanks, Alice. But your clothes are always so colorful and bold! Do you follow fashion trends?
Alice: Sometimes! But I mostly wear what makes me happy. Today, I feel like a happy cloud!
Bob: A very shiny, happy cloud. So, are these boots in fashion now?
Alice: Maybe not _yet_ , but they will be! I'm a trendsetter, Bob.
Bob: Right, a trendsetter. My fashion goal is just to match my socks. It's a struggle.
Alice: Haha! Matching socks is a good start. What about for a party? Do you dress up?
Bob: For a party? Yes, I try. Maybe a clean t-shirt. Sometimes even a shirt with buttons!
Alice: Oh, fancy! Well, your "comfy couch potato" look works for you, Bob. It's authentic.
Bob: And your "Cloudy with a chance of sparkles" look is definitely authentic too, Alice!
Alice: Exactly! Fashion is fun.
