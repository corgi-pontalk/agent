Alice : Hey Bob, long time no see! How have you been? Bob : Alice! I'm great, thanks. Just trying to survive my cat's latest 'art' project. Alice : Oh no, not again! What is she into now? Bob : Rearranging all my books by color. It's... a hobby, I guess. Speaking of hobbies, what do _you_ usually do for fun these days? Alice : Well, I've been learning to juggle. My kitchen is very brave. Bob : Juggling? That's quite a skill! Any particular reason? Alice : Just thought it would be cool for parties. Plus, it's a great way to use up all those spare oranges before they go bad. Bob : (Laughing) That's a very practical hobby! What else do you do besides supervising your cat's interior decorating? Alice : Hmm, I actually started collecting rubber ducks. Each one has a tiny hat. Bob : Seriously? Rubber ducks with hats? That's... unexpectedly charming. Do they have names? Alice : Of course! This one is Sir Quacks-a-Lot. He's a knight. Bob : (Laughing) That's amazing. I guess my juggling looks pretty normal now. Do you ever go out for your hobbies, or is it all indoor adventuring? Alice : Sometimes I take Sir Quacks-a-Lot for a walk in the park. He enjoys the fresh air. What about you? Juggling at the park? Bob : Not yet, I don't want to accidentally hit a squirrel. Maybe a quiet garden. It sounds like we have very unique ways to relax! Alice : Definitely! We should have a hobby show-and-tell sometime. Bob : I'm in! I'll bring my oranges. You bring Sir Quacks-a-Lot.
