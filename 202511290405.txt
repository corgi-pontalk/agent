Alice: Hey Bob, what's got you grinning like that? You look like you just won the lottery.
Bob: Alice! Better than the lottery! I'm going to study abroad!
Alice: Wow, Bob! That's huge news! Where are you planning to go? To become a professional cloud-watcher in Scotland?
Bob: Not quite! I'm thinking... Japan! To master the art of ramen making!
Alice: Ramen master, really? So you'll come back speaking fluent Japanese and pulling noodles like a pro?
Bob: Exactly! Imagine: "Chef Bob's Authentic Tokyo Ramen!" My future is incredibly soupy.
Alice: Sounds... unique! But have you thought about the actual studying part? Like, courses? Tuition?
Bob: Details, details! The most important course is "Sampling Ramen from Every Prefecture 101."
Alice: (laughs) I knew it! And how about the language? Do you speak Japanese?
Bob: Uh... "Konnichiwa"? "Ramen"? "Arigato"? I'm practically fluent already!
Alice: Okay, maybe we _should_ start with some basic Japanese phrases, Bob. And look into scholarships.
Bob: Scholarships? Is that like free money for ramen research?
Alice: Kind of! It's financial aid to help you study. I _can_ help you research some options.
Bob: You're the best, Alice! Soon I'll be sending you postcards from Tokyo, perhaps with a small, delicious bowl of ramen.
Alice: Just try not to get lost on the way to the noodle shop! Good luck, Chef Bob-san!
