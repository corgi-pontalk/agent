Alice : Bob, did you see that documentary last night about human trafficking prevention? It really got me thinking. Bob : Oh, Alice, I did! Pretty heavy stuff, but super important. I was wondering what _we_ could even do. Alice : Exactly! I mean, beyond donating, what if we started a 'Neighborhood Ninja' watch group? Bob : Neighborhood Ninjas? Alice, are we talking about stealthily patrolling the streets in black turtlenecks? Alice : Well, maybe less 'ninja' and more 'super observant community members'! We'd spot suspicious activities, you know, like someone trying to sell 'discounted' exotic parrots from a trench coat. Bob : That's oddly specific. But I like the spirit! What about a 'Secret Handshake of Safety' campaign? If someone flashes the wrong handshake, we know they're up to no good! Alice : Bob, that's brilliant! Or completely bonkers, I can't decide. We could combine it! The Ninjas patrol, and the Secret Handshake identifies potential victims or perpetrators. Bob : It's a multi-pronged approach! We'd need code words, too. Like, 'The pineapple is ripe' means 'Alert the authorities!' Alice : And 'The squirrel has a tiny hat' means 'I need coffee, immediately, this surveillance is tiring.' Bob : Perfect! But seriously, spreading awareness about online safety and how traffickers recruit is probably the most effective thing. Alice : Yeah, you're right. Our ninja-handshake plan might be a _tad_ elaborate. Maybe we start with a social media campaign, sharing tips from reputable organizations? Bob : Definitely. We could call it 'Operation: Real-World Vigilance.' Less black turtlenecks, more share buttons. Alice : I suppose. No tiny hats for squirrels, either? Bob : We can save the tiny hats for our 'post-prevention-success' celebration. Imagine, a world without trafficking, and squirrels in tiny hats! Alice : Now _that's_ a world worth fighting for, Bob.
