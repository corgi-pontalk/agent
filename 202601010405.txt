Alice and Bob are friends. Bob just discovered something surprising at home. Bob : Alice, you won't believe what I found this morning! Alice : Oh, Bob, that sounds ominous. What is it? Bob : It's my 'World's Best Friend' mug. Or, what's left of it. Alice : Oh no! The one with the slightly chipped handle? I am so, so sorry! I accidentally knocked it off the counter yesterday. Bob : Slightly chipped? Alice, it's in three pieces! And it wasn't just _any_ mug. It was a gift from my grandma! Alice : I know, I feel terrible! I was trying to reach the top shelf for the cookies, and my elbow... just _slipped_. Bob : Cookies over my grandma's mug? That's a low blow, Alice. A very low blow. Alice : Please don't be mad! I promise to buy you a new one. A better one! Bob : A _better_ one? Can it replace the sentimental value? Alice : Maybe not, but I can get you a 'World's Best Friend' mug _and_ a whole box of those super-fancy cookies! Bob : Hmm, cookies you say? Are they the double chocolate chip kind? Alice : Absolutely! And I'll even clean up the mess right now. Bob : Alright, alright. I guess I can't stay mad at you for too long. But next time, ask for help with the cookies! Alice : Thank you, Bob! You're the best. I really am sorry. Bob : It's okay, Alice. Just try to be more careful, especially around fragile heirlooms. Alice : I will! And I'll bring the cookies tomorrow.
