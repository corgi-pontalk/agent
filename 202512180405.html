        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey, Bob! Are you excited for the Spring Festival next month?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Oh, yes! I almost forgot! Is that the one with all the yummy food?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, yes, that's almost every festival for you! But especially this one has great street food.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> My favorite kind! What else do people usually do there?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Well, there's often live music, some traditional dances, and lots of colorful decorations. It's very lively!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Dances? Oh no, my dancing is more like a happy robot trying to avoid puddles.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (Laughing) Don't worry, Bob, you don't have to dance! Just enjoy the atmosphere. Do you have a favorite festival?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hmm, I really like the Summer Music Fest. It's not super traditional, but the bands are amazing.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, I've heard about that one! Is it like a giant picnic with guitars?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Exactly! And sometimes, there's a guy juggling fire. It's pretty cool!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Fire juggling? Okay, that sounds exciting! I might have to check that out.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> You should! We could go together.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> That's a great idea! I can be your human shield if the fire gets too close.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Perfect! And I can help you find the best food stalls. It's a deal!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Deal! I'm already looking forward to it.</p>

    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <p><strong>1. The Present Simple Tense</strong></p>
            <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about habits, routines, general truths, and things that happen regularly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Structure:</em> Subject + Verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it).</li>
                <li><em>Examples from dialogue:</em> "What else do people <strong>usually do</strong> there?" "It <strong>is</strong> very lively!" "My dancing <strong>is</strong> more like a happy robot."</li>
                <li><em>Explanation:</em> Alice uses "do" because she's asking about <em>usual</em> activities at a festival. Bob talks about his dancing as a general truth about himself.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <p><strong>2. Talking about the Future (Plans and Possibilities)</strong></p>
            <p>In English, there are several ways to talk about the future. For beginners, it's good to know "be going to" for clear plans, and that other words like "might" or "could" show possibility or suggestion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><strong>"Be going to" for Plans:</strong></em> Subject + (am/is/are) + going to + base verb.
                    <br><em>Example:</em> "I <strong>am going to visit</strong> the festival next year." (A definite plan)</li>
                <li><em><strong>Expressing Excitement for the Future:</strong></em> "Are you excited for...?" (implies future attendance/experience)
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>Are you excited for</strong> the Spring Festival next month?"</li>
                <li><em><strong>"Might" for Possibility:</strong></em> We use "might" to say something is possible.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I <strong>might have to check</strong> that out." (Alice thinks it's possible she will go)</li>
                <li><em><strong>"Could" for Suggestions:</strong></em> We use "could" to suggest an Haction or possibility.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "We <strong>could go</strong> together." (Bob is suggesting they go)</li>
                <li><em><strong>"Looking forward to" for Future Expectation:</strong></em> Expresses excitement about a future event.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I'm already <strong>looking forward to</strong> it."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Explanation:</em> Natural conversations use a mix of these. "Are you excited for...?" implies a future event. "Might" and "could" are common for talking about future possibilities or suggestions, making conversations sound more natural and less like strict plans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <p><strong>3. Adjectives for Description</strong></p>
            <p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns (people, places, things). They make your sentences more interesting and specific.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Examples from dialogue:</em> "<strong>yummy</strong> food", "<strong>great</strong> street food", "<strong>colorful</strong> decorations", "<strong>lively</strong> atmosphere", "<strong>amazing</strong> bands", "<strong>pretty cool</strong>".</li>
                <li><em>Explanation:</em> Notice how these words help Alice and Bob paint a picture of the festivals and food. Using adjectives helps others understand what you are talking about.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grammar-point">
            <p><strong>4. Asking Questions (Wh-questions and Yes/No questions)</strong></p>
            <p>Knowing how to ask different types of questions is crucial for having a conversation and getting the information you need.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wh-questions:</strong> Use words like <em>What, Where, When, Who, Why, How</em> to ask for specific information.
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>What</strong> else do people usually do there?"</li>
                <li><strong>Yes/No questions:</strong> Start with an auxiliary verb (like <em>Are, Do, Is</em>) and can be answered with "Yes" or "No".
                    <br><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>Are</strong> you excited for the Spring Festival next month?" "<strong>Do</strong> you have a favorite festival?"</li>
            </ul>
