        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Four slices? Bob, are you sure? You'll turn into a pizza!</p>

        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: We have orange juice and water. Or milk if you prefer.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Orange juice sounds great! And a big glass, please.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Okay, one very large orange juice coming up. Are you going to eat all four slices by yourself?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Of course! And maybe a cookie for dessert. Do we have cookies?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: We do! But maybe just one. Don't want you to explode before dinner!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Sounds like a plan! This is the best lunch ever, Alice. Thank you!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You're welcome, Bob! Enjoy your pizza mountain.</p>
