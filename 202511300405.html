    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Hey Bob, how was your weekend?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oh, hi Alice! Mine was okay, but yours looks… interesting. Did you wrestle a bear?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Worse! I survived my first week of homestay. It's an adventure!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oh, right! How's it going? Are they nice?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> They're super nice! My host mom, Mrs. Daisy, is a fantastic cook. But she thinks 'dessert' means 'second dinner'.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Second dinner? Sounds like a challenge!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> It is! Yesterday, she made me eat two slices of apple pie <em>after</em> a huge roast. I almost exploded!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Haha! Good luck with your stomach, Alice. Any other surprises?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Well, their dog, Sparky, sleeps on my bed. I woke up with a furry roommate this morning!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> No way! That's... cozy?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> It's certainly warm! And the host dad, Mr. John, tells me bedtime stories. He's 60, I'm 20, but the stories are pretty good!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Bedtime stories? That's hilarious! What kind of stories?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Mainly about his pet goldfish when he was a kid. Very dramatic stuff.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Sounds like a unique experience. Are you practicing your English a lot?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Oh yes! Mostly at the dinner table, trying to explain why I can't eat a third slice of pie.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> That's a useful skill! Are there any house rules?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Definitely. No shoes inside – which is common here. And I have to feed Sparky in the morning. That's my main chore.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> At least it's not washing dishes for an hour.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> True! And Sparky is cute, even if he's a bed hog.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> So, all in all, would you recommend homestay?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Absolutely! It's a bit crazy, a bit new, but I feel like part of the family already. And my English is getting better, even if it's just from talking to a dog.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Talking to a dog counts! That's immersive!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly! And I'm learning new words like 'gargantuan' for Mrs. Daisy's portions.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Haha! You're making me want to try it!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> You should! Just be prepared for surprise desserts and furry bedmates.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> I'll keep that in mind. Do they have Wi-Fi at least?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Yes, thankfully! Otherwise, I'd probably write letters to my actual family complaining about pie.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Good to know they're not completely old-fashioned.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Well, Mr. John still uses a flip phone. But he knows how to share Wi-Fi!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> That's a win! Glad it's going well, Alice.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Thanks, Bob! See you later!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Homestay is a popular way for students and travelers to live with a local family in a foreign country. It offers a unique opportunity for cultural immersion and language practice, allowing you to experience daily life, customs, and traditions firsthand. While it can be an enriching experience, it also means adapting to new house rules, different foods, and sometimes overcoming a language barrier. Many people choose homestay to improve their language skills faster and get a more authentic local perspective compared to staying in hotels or dormitories.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Simple Present Tense</h3>
    <p>We use the <strong>Simple Present Tense</strong> to talk about habits, routines, facts, and general truths.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + base form of the verb.
            <ul>
                <li>For "he," "she," "it" (and singular nouns), we add an "-s" or "-es" to the verb.</li>
                <li>For "I," "you," "we," "they" (and plural nouns), the verb stays in its base form.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"She <strong>thinks</strong> 'dessert' means 'second dinner'." (Habit/belief)</li>
                <li>"Sparky <strong>sleeps</strong> on my bed." (Habit/routine)</li>
                <li>"Mr. John <strong>tells</strong> me bedtime stories." (Routine)</li>
                <li>"It <strong>is</strong> an adventure!" (Fact)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Present Continuous Tense</h3>
    <p>We use the <strong>Present Continuous Tense</strong> to talk about actions happening right now, temporary situations, or ongoing events.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + am/is/are + verb-ing.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"How's it <strong>going</strong>?" (Action happening now)</li>

                <li>"My English <strong>is getting</strong> better." (Ongoing process)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Adjectives for Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Adjectives</strong> are words that describe nouns (people, places, things, ideas). They give us more information about the noun.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"They're <strong>super nice</strong>!" ("nice" describes "they")</li>
