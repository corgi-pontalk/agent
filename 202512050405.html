        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, you look like you've seen a ghost! What's wrong?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice, it's just so hard! I tried to make a new friend today, and it was a disaster.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh no, what happened? Did you offer them a pet rock?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Worse! I accidentally introduced myself as "Sir Reginald Fluffington." It just slipped out!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (Laughing) Sir Reginald? That's... memorable. Not ideal for "making friends," maybe.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Exactly! How do people do it? Just walk up and say "Hi"?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Well, yes, often. Or you can find common interests. Like, "Hey, cool T-shirt! Are you a fan of [band/movie] too?"</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Common interests... Hmm. What if they don't like my common interest, which is collecting lint?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Okay, maybe aim for slightly more universal interests at first. Like coffee, or the weather. "Great weather today, isn't it?"</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> That sounds so... normal. I'm Sir Reginald Fluffington!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (Smiling) Yes, well, maybe save Sir Reginald for close friends who appreciate your unique charm.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> So, just be myself, but a less "Sir Reginald" version?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! And smile! A friendly smile can go a long way.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A smile? I can do that! (Attempts a stiff, wide smile)</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> (Chuckles) Perfect. Now go forth and conquer the world... with a normal smile.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Making friends is a fundamental part of human connection and well-being. For beginners learning English, it's not just about forming social bonds but also a fantastic way to practice the language in real-world situations. In today's world, making friends can sometimes feel challenging, whether it's due to busy schedules, moving to a new place, or simply shyness. However, with the rise of online communities and various social groups, there are more opportunities than ever to meet new people.</p>
        <p>People often connect over shared hobbies, work, or school. Many apps and websites are dedicated to helping people find others with similar interests. While it might seem daunting at first, remember that most people are open to making new connections. The key is to be open, friendly, and willing to initiate conversation, just like Alice suggests to Bob. For English learners, interacting with native speakers or other learners can significantly improve speaking and listening skills, while also providing valuable cultural insights.</p>
