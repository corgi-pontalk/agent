        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, guess what I was thinking about today?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, Alice? Tell me! Is it about pizza or pandas?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Even bigger! I was thinking about 'international relations'.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Whoa, big words! What's that, like countries talking to each other?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! Like when you share your snacks with me, but sometimes I eat all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hey! That's not fair! So, countries need to share too?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Yes, ideally! They trade things, like coffee for computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So, if I give you my cookie, you give me your juice? It's like a big swap meet!
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Sort of! But sometimes, countries disagree, like when we argue about which movie to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, the 'action movie vs. rom-com' debate! So, what do countries do then?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: They try to talk it out, find a 'win-win' solution. Like we do with the movie – we watch one this week, one next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: That's smart! So, good international relations mean countries are friends, like us?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! And they help each other. Like when I help you with your homework.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And I help you reach the top shelf! So, it's about being good neighbors, but globally.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You got it, Bob! High five for international understanding!

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>
            "International relations" is about how different countries interact with each other. Imagine countries as big neighbors! Sometimes they cooperate, like sharing toys or trading snacks. For example, one country might sell bananas to another, and buy cars in return. This is called "trade". Sometimes, they might disagree, just like friends do. When this happens, they usually try to "talk it out" to find a solution that works for everyone, often called a "win-win solution". The goal is to be "good neighbors" on a global scale, helping each other and living peacefully.

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Simple Present Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the simple present tense for actions that are habits, general truths, or facts. It describes things that happen regularly or are always true.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subject + Verb (base form or -s/-es for he/she/it)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"countries <strong>talk</strong> to each other" (general truth)</li>
            <li>"They <strong>trade</strong> things" (habit/general action)</li>
            <li>"countries <strong>disagree</strong>" (general truth)</li>
            <li>"I <strong>help</strong> you with your homework." (habit/general action)</li>
            <li>"It <strong>is</strong> like a big swap meet." (fact/general truth)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Using "Like" for Comparison</h3>
        <p>"Like" is often used to show that two things are similar or to give an example. It means "similar to" or "for example".</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sentence + like + Noun / Noun Phrase / Clause</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"...What's that, <strong>like</strong> countries talking to each other?" (similar to)</li>
            <li>"<strong>Like</strong> when you share your snacks with me..." (for example, similar situation)</li>
            <li>"...countries disagree, <strong>like</strong> when we argue..." (for example, similar situation)</li>
            <li>"...countries are friends, <strong>like</strong> us?" (similar to)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Wh- Questions (What, How)</h3>
        <p>We use 'Wh- questions' to ask for specific information. For beginners, 'What' and 'How' are very common.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What</strong>: Asks about things, ideas, or actions.</li>
            <li><strong>How</strong>: Asks about the way something is done, the condition, or quantity (with adjectives/adverbs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"<strong>What's</strong> that...?" (What is that?)</li>
            <li>"<strong>What</strong> do countries do then?"</li>
        </ul>
