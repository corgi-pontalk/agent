            <p>Alice: Hey Bob, what do you want to do today?</p>
            <p>Bob: Hmm, Alice, I just want to relax.</p>
            <p>Alice: Relax? But we always relax! Let's go somewhere!</p>
            <p>Bob: Go where? My bed is calling me.</p>
            <p>Alice: No, no! Let's go to the park! We can play frisbee!</p>
            <p>Bob: Play? That sounds likeâ€¦ exercise. Can we eat first?</p>
            <p>Alice: Bob! You always want to eat! What do you want to eat?</p>
            <p>Bob: Pizza! And then drink some soda.</p>
            <p>Alice: Pizza and soda? That's not very healthy for playing frisbee.</p>
            <p>Bob: It's fuel! After pizza, I can definitely go play. Maybe.</p>
            <p>Alice: Okay, fine. We can eat pizza. But <em>then</em> we go to the park and play frisbee for at least an hour.</p>
            <p>Bob: Deal! But I also want to drink a big milkshake after playing.</p>
            <p>Alice: You're impossible! But okay, a milkshake sounds good. So, first we eat pizza, then we go to the park to play, and then we drink milkshakes?</p>
            <p>Bob: Perfect plan, Alice! You're the best!</p>
            <p>Alice: I know, Bob. Now, let's go get that pizza!</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>Simple Present Tense for Basic Verbs</h3>
        <p>We often use "go," "eat," "drink," and "play" in the simple present tense to talk about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Habits or routines:</strong> things you do regularly.</li>
            <li><strong>General truths:</strong> facts that are always true.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduled events:</strong> things that happen at a specific time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Forming the Simple Present:</h4>
        <p>The form of the verb changes depending on the subject (who is doing the action).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For <strong>I, You, We, They</strong>: Use the base form of the verb.
                <ul>
                    <li>I <strong>go</strong> to school.</li>
                    <li>You <strong>eat</strong> breakfast.</li>
                    <li>We <strong>drink</strong> tea.</li>
                    <li>They <strong>play</strong> games.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For <strong>He, She, It</strong>: Add <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-es</strong> to the base form.
                <ul>
                    <li>He <strong>goes</strong> to work. (add -es to 'go')</li>
                    <li>She <strong>eats</strong> an apple. (add -s to 'eat')</li>
                    <li>It <strong>drinks</strong> milk. (add -s to 'drink', for an animal)</li>
                    <li>He <strong>plays</strong> the guitar. (add -s to 'play')</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Questions and Negative Sentences:</h4>
        <p>To ask questions or make negative sentences in the simple present, we use "do" or "does."</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> When you use "does" or "doesn't," the main verb (go, eat, drink, play) always goes back to its basic form (no -s or -es).</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With I, You, We, They:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Question: <strong>Do</strong> you <strong>go</strong> to the park?</li>
                    <li>Negative: I <strong>do not (don't)</strong> <strong>eat</strong> meat.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>With He, She, It:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Question: <strong>Does</strong> she <strong>drink</strong> coffee? (NOT "Does she drinks coffee?")</li>
                    <li>Negative: He <strong>does not (doesn't)</strong> <strong>play</strong> sports. (NOT "He doesn't plays sports.")</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
