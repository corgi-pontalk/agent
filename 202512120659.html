    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey, Bob! You catch the news about golf lately? It's been wild!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! News? Oh, no, don't tell me my fantasy golf team is being bought out by a sovereign wealth fund too. I just drafted a killer putter!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Ha, not quite that personal, thankfully! I'm talking about the whole PGA Tour and LIV Golf drama, and the Saudi investment. It's all over the sports headlines.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, *that* saga. I thought that was just a really expensive reality TV show about guys in polos getting ridiculously rich. Is it still going on?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Well, it *is* about money, an incredible amount, but also about the integrity of the sport, and, you know, 'sportswashing'.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Sportswashing? Is that when you try to get a grass stain out of your favorite golf shirt with a diamond-encrusted iron? Because I’m pretty sure that just makes a bigger mess.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Laughs) Close! It's more like using a glamorous sport to divert attention from less glamorous human rights records. It's a PR strategy.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Gotcha. So, basically, a very fancy PR campaign with putters. But seriously, the amount of money involved is insane. Billions!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Right? Millions, billions! And remember how some players were so against LIV, calling them 'traitors' and saying they'd ruined golf? And now... poof, a merger proposal!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, the old 'principles before profit' until a bigger profit comes along. It's like my diet plan: totally committed until someone mentions pizza. The hypocrisy is almost impressive.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! And fans are so confused. Is it good for golf? Is it just a money grab? Who knows what tournament to watch anymore, or who to root for!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: They should just combine all the tours, make everyone wear matching sparkly jumpsuits, and have a mandatory dance-off after every hole. Now *that's* entertainment I'd pay for.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You're ridiculous! But seriously, the ethics of taking that investment... it's a big debate. Some people are really torn.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Yeah, 'ethics' and 'billions of dollars' rarely play well together in the same sandbox. I just hope they don't start replacing the golf carts with flying carpets. That would mess with my fantasy team's aerodynamics.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You've got a point. It's definitely a complex issue with no easy answers. Maybe I should just stick to mini-golf for now.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Mini-golf it is! At least there, the biggest ethical dilemma is whether you cheat on the windmill hole. Much simpler.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The world of professional golf has been embroiled in significant controversy over the past few years, primarily due to the emergence of LIV Golf, a new professional golf tour financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Initially, LIV Golf attracted many high-profile players from the established PGA Tour with lucrative contracts, leading to a fierce rivalry and a divided sport.</p>
    <p>The PGA Tour criticized LIV Golf for "sportswashing" – using a glamorous sport to improve Saudi Arabia's international reputation, particularly in light of its human rights record. Players who joined LIV were often ostracized by their former PGA Tour colleagues and faced bans from traditional tournaments.</p>
    <p>However, in a surprising turn of events in June 2023, the PGA Tour, DP World Tour, and PIF announced plans for a merger, aiming to create a new commercial entity. This proposed alliance sparked outrage and confusion among many, including players who had remained loyal to the PGA Tour, fans, and politicians, who raised concerns about antitrust implications and the ethical considerations of partnering with the Saudi PIF. The proposed merger is currently under review by various regulatory bodies globally, and the future structure of professional golf remains uncertain, still generating considerable debate and discussion.</p>
