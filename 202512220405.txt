Alice : Bob, help! I have a job interview tomorrow! Bob : Alice, again? Didn't you just have one last week? Alice : This one's important! And I'm so nervous. What do I even do? Bob : First, breathe. Second, remember the basics. Look presentable. Alice : Presentable? Like, no sweatpants? Bob : Ideally, yes. Iron your shirt, maybe. And try to arrive on time. Alice : On time... or ten minutes early to show enthusiasm? Bob : Ten minutes early is perfect! Shows you're keen. Alice : Okay, clothes, timing. What about questions? What if they ask me something super hard? Bob : They usually start with "Tell me about yourself." Practice a short, positive answer. Alice : "I like pizza and long naps." Is that positive? Bob : (Chuckles) Maybe something more about your skills or experience. Like, "I'm a hard worker and quick learner." Alice : Oh! Right. And what about my weaknesses? I have so many! Bob : Choose a small one you're working on, like "Sometimes I get too excited about new projects." Alice : Haha, good one! Okay, Bob, you're a lifesaver. No sweatpants, on time, positive answers. I can do this!
