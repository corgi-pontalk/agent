    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, how's everything? I was just thinking about your city.</p>
        <p>Bob: Hi Alice! My city? Oh, it's... well, it's an adventure! What about yours?</p>
        <p>Alice: Mine is also an adventure, but a different kind. So, what's your city like, Bob? Is it full of flying cars yet?</p>
        <p>Bob: Haha, not yet! My city is quite busy, lots of tall buildings. The weather is usually sunny, which is nice.</p>
        <p>Alice: Sunny? Lucky you! In my city, the weather has a split personality. It can be sunny, rainy, and windy all in one hour!</p>
        <p>Bob: That sounds... unpredictable! What about the food? What are you famous for?</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh, we're famous for our 'Mystery Meat Pie' – it’s delicious, but nobody really knows what's inside! And our 'Giant Purple Pickles'.</p>
        <p>Bob: Mystery Meat Pie and Giant Purple Pickles? That's definitely unique, Alice! Do people actually eat those?</p>
        <p>Alice: Absolutely! You must try them if you ever visit. It's an experience. The people here are very friendly, but always in a hurry.</p>
        <p>Bob: Sounds like a fun place! Is it easy to get around? Like, do you have a good metro or do you need a rocket?</p>
        <p>Alice: We have a fantastic metro! But also, a lot of very creative drivers. Crossing the street is like a mini-Olympic sport.</p>
        <p>Bob: A mini-Olympic sport? That's hilarious! Are there any famous landmarks or quirky spots?</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh yes! We have 'The Leaning Tower of Pizza' – it's actually just a pizza place that was built a bit crooked. And a park where all the squirrels wear tiny hats.</p>
        <p>Bob: Squirrels with hats?! Okay, Alice, now I <em>really</em> want to visit your city. It sounds incredibly entertaining.</p>
        <p>Alice: It is! The best part is, you never know what you'll see next. Just bring an umbrella and an appetite for adventure!</p>
        <p>Bob: I'll keep that in mind! Thanks for the tour, Alice. Maybe I'll visit soon and try a Mystery Meat Pie.</p>
        <p>Alice: You're welcome, Bob! Just don't ask about the ingredients. See you!</p>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Adjectives for Description</h3>
        <p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns (people, places, things). We use them to give more information about our city.</p>

                <br><em>Example:</em> "It has <strong>tall buildings</strong>." (Adjective before noun)</li>
