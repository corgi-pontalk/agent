        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, have you been <em>glued to the news</em> about the racial justice protests lately? My brain feels like it's <em>on overload</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, you're telling me! I tried to catch up on Twitter yesterday and ended up going down a <em>rabbit hole</em> of <em>think pieces</em> and viral videos. My feed is 90% protest updates, 10% cat memes.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha, sounds about right. I saw that massive march in D.C. – just incredible to see so many people come together.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Definitely. It really shows the power of <em>collective action</em>, doesn't it? Though sometimes I wonder if my <em>armchair activism</em> of retweeting actually does anything.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey, every little bit helps <em>spread awareness</em>. But it's more than just awareness now, isn't it? It feels like a real <em>turning point</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Totally. Remember when we talked about <em>systemic issues</em> and how hard they are to change? Now it feels like those conversations are finally <em>hitting the mainstream</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Yeah, it's bittersweet. Heartbreaking what it took to get here, but encouraging to see the conversations shifting towards actual <em>policy changes</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Speaking of which, did you see that city council meeting where they were discussing police reform? It got pretty <em>heated</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, I missed that! I've been trying to follow the local stuff, but there's just so much happening globally too. It's like a whirlwind.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I know! One minute I'm reading about reparations discussions, the next it's about voting rights. My <em>head's spinning</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Mine too! I keep wanting to do more, but then I get lost in the sheer scale of it all. What's the best way to support, you know, beyond just signing petitions?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Good question. I've been looking into local community organizations. They often have specific needs, like volunteers or donations for specific programs.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: That's a great idea, Bob. Much more tangible than just <em>doom-scrolling</em>. Maybe we could look into some together?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Sounds like a plan, Alice. At least we can navigate this complex landscape together, even if it feels like we're constantly <em>playing catch-up</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! And maybe we'll find some actual cats doing activism somewhere. That would break the tension.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The United States has a long and complex history with racial injustice. In recent years, particularly following high-profile incidents of police brutality against Black individuals, a renewed and powerful wave of racial justice protests has emerged. These movements, often spearheaded by organizations like Black Lives Matter, gained significant global attention, especially after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020.</p>
        <p>The protests extend beyond individual acts of violence, highlighting deeper systemic issues such as racial bias in the justice system, disparities in economic opportunity, housing, education, and healthcare. Demands typically include comprehensive police reform, accountability for misconduct, an end to discriminatory practices, and a broader reckoning with historical injustices like slavery and segregation.</p>
        <p>While the intensity of large-scale street demonstrations has varied, the conversations surrounding racial justice have firmly entered mainstream political and social discourse. This has led to some legislative changes at local and state levels, increased corporate commitments to diversity and inclusion, and a greater public awareness of systemic racism. However, activists continue to advocate for more substantial and lasting policy changes to achieve genuine equity and justice for all.</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "have you been glued to", "I've been trying")</strong>
                <p>This tense is used to talk about actions that started in the past and are still continuing up to the present moment, or have recently stopped but have an effect on the present. It emphasizes the duration or ongoing nature of the action.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Form:</strong> <code>has/have + been + verb-ing (present participle)</code></li>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<code>Have you been glued to</code> the news...?" (The act of watching the news started in the past and continues.)</li>
                    <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I'<code>ve been trying</code> to follow the local stuff..." (The effort to follow started in the past and is ongoing.)</li>
                    <li><em>Another example:</em> "She <code>has been studying</code> English for five years." (The studying started five years ago and continues now.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Phrasal Verbs (e.g., "catch up on", "come together", "look into")</strong>
                <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that, when used together, create a new meaning different from the original verb. They are very common in informal English conversation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Catch up on</strong>: To get the latest information about something.
                        <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "I tried to <code>catch up on</code> Twitter yesterday."</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Come together</strong>: To unite; to gather in one place.
                        <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "...to see so many people <code>come together</code>."</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Look into</strong>: To investigate or examine something.
                        <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "Maybe we could <code>look into</code> some together?"</li></ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Idiomatic Expressions (e.g., "on overload", "head's spinning", "rabbit hole")</strong>
                <p>Idioms are phrases where the meaning isn't obvious from the individual words. They add color and naturalness to conversation, but often need to be learned as a whole unit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On overload</strong>: Feeling overwhelmed (as if your system has too much input).</li>
                    <li><strong>Head's spinning</strong>: Feeling confused or overwhelmed by too much information or activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Go down a rabbit hole</strong>: To get lost in a complex and often time-consuming tangent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Expressing Opinions and Perceptions ("It feels like...", "It shows...", "I wonder if...")</strong>
                <p>These phrases are crucial for expressing personal opinions, observations, and degrees of certainty in a conversational manner.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It feels like... / It seems like...</strong>: Used to express a personal perception or impression.
                        <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "<code>It feels like</code> a real turning point."</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>It really shows...</strong>: Used to highlight what something reveals or demonstrates.
                        <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "<code>It really shows</code> the power of collective action."</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>I wonder if...</strong>: Used to express curiosity, doubt, or a soft suggestion.
                        <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "Though sometimes <code>I wonder if</code> my armchair activism... actually does anything."</li></ul>
                    </li>
