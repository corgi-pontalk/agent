Alice: Oh, Bob, thank goodness! I thought I'd never find anyone!
Bob: Alice? What are you doing here? You look a bit... lost.
Alice: I am! Completely! I'm trying to find the new cat cafe, "Purr-fect Coffee." Do you know where it is?
Bob: Purr-fect Coffee? Hmm, I think I know it. It's not too far from here.
Alice: Really? That's great! My map app is sending me in circles. It says "turn right at the giant banana statue," but there's no banana statue!
Bob: (Laughs) There _was_ a giant banana statue, but they moved it last month. It's now a giant pineapple!
Alice: A pineapple? No wonder! So, how do I get to the cat cafe from here?
Bob: Okay, so from here, walk straight ahead for about two blocks.
Alice: Straight ahead, two blocks. Got it.
Bob: Then, you'll see a big red building on your left. That's a toy store.
Alice: A toy store, on my left. Okay.
Bob: Turn right after the toy store. The cat cafe will be right there, next to the small park.
Alice: So, straight for two blocks, red toy store on the left, then turn right, and it's next to the park. Got it! Thank you so much, Bob! You're a lifesaver!
Bob: No problem, Alice! Don't get lost again!
Alice: I'll try not to! Maybe I'll see you there later for a coffee... and a cat cuddle!
