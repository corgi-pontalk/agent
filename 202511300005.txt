Alice: Bob, have you heard about this wild MLB realignment proposal? My brain feels like scrambled eggs trying to process it.
Bob: Alice! I just read the headline! Putting the Yankees in a Pacific Northwest division? Who cooked that up?
Alice: Apparently, it's about reducing travel costs and creating 'fresh' rivalries. But Seattle vs. New York for a division title? That's just... geographically challenging.
Bob: Challenging is an understatement. It's sacrilege! My grandfather would rise from his grave if the Red Sox weren't playing the Yankees multiple times a year.
Alice: True. But imagine the possibilities! A 'Deep South' division with the Dodgers and Padres trying to figure out how to drive there.
Bob: You're enjoying this, aren't you? It would be a logistical nightmare for teams, fans, and broadcasters alike.
Alice: A little! Think of the new fan demographics. Plus, no more coast-to- coast midnight games for West Coast teams visiting the East.
Bob: That's the only pro I've heard so far. But what about the traditions? Baseball is steeped in history. This would shake things up too much.
Alice: Sometimes you need to shake things up to keep things fresh. It's just a proposal, but it's food for thought.
Bob: It's a wild card idea, that's for sure. I can't imagine any die-hard fan getting on board with their team being moved hundreds or thousands of miles away from traditional rivals.
Alice: What if it meant more competitive divisions? Less travel for players, potentially fewer injuries.
Bob: And a whole new travel budget for fans trying to follow their team! It sounds like a great way to throw a wrench in the works of every existing rivalry.
Alice: Okay, okay, you've convinced me it's not perfect. But it's fun to imagine the chaos, right?
Bob: Fun to imagine, terrifying to implement. I'm sticking with the tried and true divisions, thank you very much.
Alice: Fair enough. But if the Cubs ever join a division with the Houston Astros, I'm buying a new hat.
