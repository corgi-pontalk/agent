        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hi Bob! What's that big book you're carrying? Are you studying?</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, hi Alice! No, not studying. This is "The Little Guide to Not Tripping Over Your Own Feet." It's a comedy.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: *laughs* Seriously? I thought you only read sci-fi or fantasy!</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, I do! But sometimes, a guy needs a good laugh. What about you? Reading anything good lately?</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I just finished a detective novel. It was full of twists! I love trying to guess the killer.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Detective novels are fun! I always guess wrong, though. My favorite part is usually the snacks I eat while reading.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: *chuckles* That's a valid reading strategy! Do you prefer physical books or e-books?</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Definitely physical books. I love the smell of old pages and turning them. E-books feelâ€¦ too clean.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I get that. But e-books are great for travel. You can carry a whole library!</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: True. My backpack would weigh a ton if I brought all my favorite fantasy series.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Speaking of fantasy, have you read "Dragon's Breath and Teacups"? It's hilarious! Dragons trying to host a tea party.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Dragons and teacups? That sounds like my kind of weird! I'll add it to my reading list.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: You should! It's much better than that "Not Tripping Over Your Own Feet" guide.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Hey! It has a 4-star rating! And it's helping me. I only tripped twice yesterday.</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Progress! Maybe next week you'll be reading "Advanced Parkour for Beginners."</div>
        <div class="dialogue-text"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Don't push it, Alice. One comedy guide at a time!</div>
