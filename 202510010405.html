    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, are you sure this is the right hotel? It looks a bit... small.</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice, of course it is! 'The Cozy Corner Inn.' See? It says so right here on my phone. Cozy means nice, right?</p>
        <p>Alice: Well, sometimes 'cozy' means 'fits one person and a teacup.' Let's go in.</p>
        <p>Bob: (Bumps into the doorframe) Oops! My bad. Hello, front desk!</p>
        <p>Receptionist: Welcome to The Cozy Corner Inn! How can I help you?</p>
        <p>Bob: Hi! We have a reservation under 'Bob Wobbly.' For two nights.</p>
        <p>Receptionist: Ah, Mr. Wobbly! Yes, a single room with a... 'compact' bed.</p>
        <p>Alice: (Raises an eyebrow at Bob) A single room? Bob, we're two people!</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh! Did I click 'single' by mistake? I thought 'single' meant 'super cool'!</p>
        <p>Alice: No, Bob. 'Single' means one. Like, one banana. Not two people and two suitcases.</p>
        <p>Bob: Receptionist, do you have any other rooms? Maybe with a 'double' bed? Or a 'super cool' bed for two?</p>
        <p>Receptionist: Let me check... We have one double room left, but it's on the 10th floor. And the elevator is... charmingly old.</p>
        <p>Bob: 10th floor? Phew! That's high. But a double bed! Perfect! What about the bathroom? Is there a shower?</p>
        <p>Alice: Bob, most hotels have showers. Just confirm the room number, please.</p>
        <p>Receptionist: Room 1001. Here's your key card. Enjoy your stay!</p>
        <p>Bob: Thanks! Come on, Alice! To adventure! Hope the 'charming' elevator doesn't get stuck!</p>
        <p>Alice: (Sighs, but smiles) Let's just get to the room, Bob.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>When you travel, you often need a place to stay, and a hotel is a common choice. At a hotel, you will usually go to the "front desk" or "reception" to "check in." You'll give your name and confirm your "reservation." The receptionist will then give you a "key card" or a key to your "room." Rooms can be "single" (for one person) or "double" (for two people, often with a larger bed). Sometimes, there might be small problems, like a mistaken booking or an old elevator, which can make for a funny story!</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Are you sure...?</strong>: Used to ask if someone is certain about something.

            <br><em>Example:</em> Welcome! How can I help you today?</li>
        <li><strong>We have a reservation under [name].</strong>: To state that you have a booking under a specific name.
            <br><em>Example:</em> We have a reservation under Smith.</li>
        <li><strong>Single room / Double room</strong>: Types of hotel rooms. A "single" room typically has one bed for one person. A "double" room usually has one larger bed for two people.
            <br><em>Example:</em> I need a single room for tonight. / Do you have any double rooms available?</li>
        <li><strong>By mistake</strong>: Accidentally, without intending to.
            <br><em>Example:</em> I took the wrong umbrella by mistake.</li>
        <li><strong>Let me check</strong>: Used when you need to look for information or confirm something.
            <br><em>Example:</em> Let me check the schedule for you.</li>
