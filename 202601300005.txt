Alice : Bob, did you see the news again? "Middle East Peace Process Stalled... Again!" Bob : Alice, it's starting to feel like a recurring soap opera with the same cliffhanger every season. Alice : Right? At this point, I'm expecting them to announce a new spin- off: 'Negotiators: The Prequel,' explaining why they can't even agree on coffee. Bob : Coffee! I bet that's where the real issues lie. "We demand only single-origin Yemeni beans!" "No, we insist on Turkish coffee, extra strong!" Alice : See! And then someone will bring up a historical coffee dispute from the 14th century, and boom, talks are stalled for another decade. Bob : It's like they're playing a giant, real-life game of 'Diplomacy,' but no one ever wins, and everyone just keeps accusing each other of hoarding the wheat. Alice : And the UN is just there, like the referee who's given up and is now just checking their phone. Bob : Seriously. I wish they'd just try a different approach. Maybe a mandatory karaoke session? Nothing breaks the ice like a duet of 'We Are the World'. Alice : Or a baking competition! 'The Great Middle East Bake-Off.' The prize? Lasting peace! Bob : Now _that_ I'd watch. Imagine the arguments over who kneaded the dough correctly. "That's not a proper za'atar bread!" Alice : And then one side accuses the other of using too much paprika, and the whole thing collapses. Bob : Back to square one. Just like the actual talks. It's almost impressive how consistently they manage to *not* make progress. Alice : It's a masterclass in professional disagreement. They should teach it at negotiation schools: 'How to Stagnate with Style'. Bob : I'd sign up for that class! Although, I'd probably just end up stalling on my tuition payments. Alice : Classic Bob. Speaking of stalling, I should probably get back to work before my boss notices *my* peace process with deadlines has stalled.
