Alice : Hey, Bob, guess what I was just daydreaming about? Bob : Let me guess, Alice. A world where socks don't disappear in the laundry? Alice : Close! Actually, it was my dream trip to America. Bob : America, huh? Sounds expensive. My dream trip involves a very large, very comfy couch. Alice : Oh, come on! Think big! Imagine, first, New York City – Broadway shows, Times Square, eating a giant slice of pizza. Bob : Pizza sounds good. But maybe we could split one slice among four people to save money? And sleep in a hostel... with bunk beds... and a shared bathroom. Alice : Bob! This is a dream trip, not a survival challenge! After New York, we absolutely have to hit up California. Hollywood, beaches, maybe even Disneyland! Bob : Disneyland? The lines alone would exhaust my budget for joy. How about a scenic drive instead? Less crowds, more gas station coffee. Alice : You know what? I'll compromise. A scenic drive, but through national parks like Yellowstone or Grand Canyon! Imagine the selfies! Bob : Okay, Yellowstone sounds epic. Just promise me we won't accidentally feed a bear. My travel insurance doesn't cover 'bear-related snack incidents'. Alice : Deal! And for food, we'd have to try all the classic American diners. Burgers, milkshakes, fries... Bob : As long as the milkshake isn't made from old socks, I'm in. What about logistics? Flights, accommodation... my wallet's already crying. Alice : Well, we'd need to save up diligently. And maybe look into some package deals. Plus, I'd definitely want to rent a car for the road trip part. Bob : A rental car? Right. As long as it's not a monster truck. My parking skills are more suited for a tricycle. And we'd need good maps – my phone always loses signal in the wilderness. Alice : That's why we'd plan everything well in advance! No last- minute scrambles. This trip needs to be perfect. Bob : Perfect, huh? Alright, Alice. You've convinced me. Now, where do we sign up for that 'dream trip lottery'?
