    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, I'm so bored! What are we doing this weekend? I need a leader to tell me!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice! You're <span class="key-phrase">calling me a leader</span>? I just know how to <span class="key-phrase">make good decisions</span>, that's all.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Well, that's what leaders do! They decide things. And usually, they <span class="key-phrase">have a plan</span>, right?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Okay, okay, you got me. My plan is: a grand expedition to the park!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Hmm, a *grand expedition*. Very leader-like! But how will we get there?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: I will <span class="key-phrase">guide us</span>! Think of me as your personal, slightly lost, GPS.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: And who will manage the snacks? A good leader <span class="key-phrase">delegates tasks</span>, you know.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Ah, an excellent point! You, Alice, are <span class="key-phrase">responsible for</span> the snacks. It's <span class="key-phrase">your responsibility</span> to keep the team fueled!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: So, you're trying to <span class="key-phrase">motivate me</span> with chips? Smart move, *Boss*.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Exactly! A true leader <span class="key-phrase">inspires their team</span> to achieve greatness... or at least find the best chips.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Alright, so what's our ultimate <span class="key-phrase">goal</span> for this "expedition"? Besides snacks, of course.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Our <span class="key-phrase">goal</span> is simple: maximum fun, minimum stress, and maybe a high-five from a squirrel. That's a <span class="key-phrase">noble aim</span>!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: What if we encounter another "team" at the park? Like, a group of frisbee champions?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Then I will <span class="key-phrase">lead our team</span> with courage and... well, maybe we'll just cheer them on. A leader knows when to support!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: You're really <span class="key-phrase">getting into this role</span>, aren't you, Captain Bob?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Someone has to! Now, <span class="key-phrase">follow your leader</span>! To the park and beyond!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Okay, *Admiral*. But I still get to choose the ice cream flavor. My first <span class="key-phrase">executive decision</span>!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Even if you're a beginner, understanding basic leadership vocabulary is very useful! You might not be leading a big company yet, but you can be a leader in your daily life. For example, when you plan a trip with friends, organize a study group, or even decide what to cook for dinner, you are using "leadership" skills. Words like "plan," "decide," "goal," and "team" are not just for bosses; they help us communicate effectively in many situations, big or small. Learning these words now will help you understand conversations, movies, and articles about teamwork and getting things done.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Simple Present Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the Simple Present Tense for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>General truths or facts:</b> Things that are always true.
                <div class="example-sentence"><em>Leaders <b>decide</b> things.</em> (It's a fact about leaders.)</div></li>
            <li><b>Habits or routines:</b> Actions that happen regularly.
                <div class="example-sentence"><em>He always <b>motivates</b> his team.</em> (It's his habit.)</div></li>
            <li><b>Abilities or general statements:</b>
                <div class="example-sentence"><em>I <b>know</b> how to make good decisions.</em> (A general ability.)</div></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember: For `he/she/it`, we add `s` or `es` to the verb (e.g., `decide` -> `decides`, `inspire` -> `inspires`).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Imperatives</h3>
        <p>Imperatives are used to give commands, instructions, or make requests directly. You use the base form of the verb (without `to` and without a subject).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Command:</b> <div class="example-sentence"><em><b>Follow</b> your leader!</em></div></li>
            <li><b>Instruction:</b> <div class="example-sentence"><em><b>Pack</b> the snacks.</em></div></li>
            <li><b>Request (often with "please"):</b> <div class="example-sentence"><em>Please <b>guide</b> us.</em></div></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Possessive Adjectives (My, Your, Our, Their)</h3>
        <p>These words show who something belongs to or is associated with. They come before a noun.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">my</span>: belongs to me. <div class="example-sentence"><em><span class="key-phrase">My</span> plan is simple.</em></div></li>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">your</span>: belongs to you. <div class="example-sentence"><em>It's <span class="key-phrase">your</span> responsibility.</em></div></li>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">our</span>: belongs to us. <div class="example-sentence"><em><span class="key-phrase">Our</span> ultimate goal is fun.</em></div></li>
            <li><span class="key-phrase">their</span>: belongs to them. <div class="example-sentence"><em>A leader inspires <span class="key-phrase">their</span> team.</em></div></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>4. "What are we doing?" (Present Continuous for Future Plans)</h3>
        <p>We often use the Present Continuous tense (am/is/are + verb-ing) to talk about plans or arrangements for the near future, especially when they are already decided.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><div class="example-sentence"><em>What <b>are we doing</b> this weekend?</em> (Asking about a planned activity.)</div></li>
            <li><div class="example-sentence"><em>We <b>are meeting</b> at 3 PM.</em> (A definite arrangement.)</div></li>
