Alice: Bob, you look like you've seen a ghost! What's wrong?
Bob: Alice, it's just so hard! I tried to make a new friend today, and it was a disaster.
Alice: Oh no, what happened? Did you offer them a pet rock?
Bob: Worse! I accidentally introduced myself as "Sir Reginald Fluffington." It just slipped out!
Alice: (Laughing) Sir Reginald? That's... memorable. Not ideal for "making friends," maybe.
Bob: Exactly! How do people do it? Just walk up and say "Hi"?
Alice: Well, yes, often. Or you can find common interests. Like, "Hey, cool T-shirt! Are you a fan of [band/movie] too?"
Bob: Common interests... Hmm. What if they don't like my common interest, which is collecting lint?
Alice: Okay, maybe aim for slightly more universal interests at first. Like coffee, or the weather. "Great weather today, isn't it?"
Bob: That sounds so... normal. I'm Sir Reginald Fluffington!
Alice: (Smiling) Yes, well, maybe save Sir Reginald for close friends who appreciate your unique charm.
Bob: So, just be myself, but a less "Sir Reginald" version?
Alice: Exactly! And smile! A friendly smile can go a long way.
Bob: A smile? I can do that! (Attempts a stiff, wide smile)
Alice: (Chuckles) Perfect. Now go forth and conquer the world... with a normal smile.
