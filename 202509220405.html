    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, Bob! Fancy meeting you here. What a surprise!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! You look like you just wrestled a shopping cart and won. What's in the bags?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, very funny. I just went on a little <strong>shopping spree</strong> at the mall. My wallet is crying!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> A 'little' spree? Those bags look heavy. Did you buy everything?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Not everything, but I found some great <strong>deals</strong>! Look, I got this amazing new <strong>sweater</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hmm, nice <strong>pattern</strong>. How much was it?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It was originally $50, but it was <strong>on sale</strong> for 30% off! What a <strong>bargain</strong>!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Wow, that's a good <strong>discount</strong>. Did you <strong>try it on</strong>?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Of course! The <strong>fitting room</strong> was a bit crowded, but it's the perfect <strong>size</strong>. It fits like a glove!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Good. Anything else interesting that drained your bank account?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, yes! A new pair of comfy <strong>sneakers</strong> and a funny <strong>mug</strong> for my morning coffee.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Sounds like a very successful trip. Did you <strong>pay</strong> with cash or card?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Card. And I made sure to get the <strong>receipt</strong> in case I need to <strong>return</strong> anything. You never know!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Smart thinking. My wallet feels lighter just hearing about your shopping!</p>
    <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Don't worry, Bob. Next time, we can go <strong>window shopping</strong> together and just look! No money needed!</p>
