    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, guess what I just stumbled upon?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice, given your usual news feed, probably another video of a cat playing the piano. Spill it!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Ha! No, seriously. I was reading about India’s competitiveness ranking, and it's surprisingly good!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, you mean beyond just tech support and Bollywood dance numbers? I'm intrigued.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! I always thought of India as an emerging market, but they're really making huge strides. They've climbed quite a few spots recently.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, for a country that basically invented zero, it's not surprising they're good at numbers. What's driving this sudden surge?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's a mix. Things like government efficiency, business legislation, and massive digital transformation efforts are really pushing them up.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Government efficiency? Are we talking about the same India where cows have the right-of-way on busy city streets?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Laugh all you want, but the reports show significant improvements in areas like infrastructure and economic performance. They're investing heavily.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> So, it's not just the Silicon Valley of India; it's the infrastructure valley too? Next thing you know, they'll be building bullet trains powered by chai.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Don't joke! Their manufacturing sector is booming, and they're becoming a significant player in global supply chains. It's not just IT anymore.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> From outsourcing to outperforming! So, they're truly leveling up across the board.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Precisely! It’s a testament to their focus on innovation and skill development. They're definitely an economic powerhouse in the making.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alright, alright, I'm convinced. Maybe I should start practicing my Namaste and investing in some spice futures. Touché, India!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Good idea! Or at least read more than just cat videos, Bob.</p>
