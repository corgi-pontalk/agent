    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, fancy seeing you here! What are you doing in the art gallery?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Fancy meeting you too! I'm... uh... admiring the snacks in the cafe, mostly. But I saw you looking at this giant canvas.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> This isn't just a canvas, Bob. It's a modern masterpiece! It's called "Crimson Chaos."</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Crimson Chaos? It looks like someone spilled red paint on a really big napkin. Is that art?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Yes, it is! Art can be many things. It makes you feel something. What do you feel?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hungry. And a little confused. Like, where's the dog? Or a nice landscape?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Not all art has dogs or landscapes. This is abstract. It's about color and form.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> So, if I spill my coffee, is that abstract art? Because I'm quite good at that.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Maybe! If you frame it and give it a fancy title. "Espresso Explosion."</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Ha! I like that! I could be an artist! What about design? Is spilling coffee good design?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Not usually for a coffee table! Design is more about making things useful and beautiful. Like, the design of this gallery space. It's so open and bright.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, I see! So, the coffee machine at home? Good design, because it makes coffee. But my coffee spill? Bad design for the table, but maybe good art for the wall.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! You're getting it! Art is expression, design is solution.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> So, my red square earlier could be art. And a red square traffic sign is design?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Perfect! Now, let's find some art that doesn't make you hungry.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Deal! But if I see a painting of a giant pizza, I call dibs on it for my collection.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Art and design are everywhere around us, even if we don't always notice them! Art is a way for people to express themselves, their feelings, and ideas, often through paintings, sculptures, music, or performance. Design, on the other hand, is about creating things that are not only beautiful but also functional and useful. From the clothes we wear and the phones we use, to the buildings we live in and the websites we browse, good design makes our lives better and easier. Both art and design play a huge role in our culture, shaping how we see the world and interact with it.</p>
