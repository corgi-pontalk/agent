Alice: Hey, Bob! Are you excited for the Spring Festival next month?
Bob: Alice! Oh, yes! I almost forgot! Is that the one with all the yummy food?
Alice: Haha, yes, that's almost every festival for you! But especially this one has great street food.
Bob: My favorite kind! What else do people usually do there?
Alice: Well, there's often live music, some traditional dances, and lots of colorful decorations. It's very lively!
Bob: Dances? Oh no, my dancing is more like a happy robot trying to avoid puddles.
Alice: (Laughing) Don't worry, Bob, you don't have to dance! Just enjoy the atmosphere. Do you have a favorite festival?
Bob: Hmm, I really like the Summer Music Fest. It's not super traditional, but the bands are amazing.
Alice: Oh, I've heard about that one! Is it like a giant picnic with guitars?
Bob: Exactly! And sometimes, there's a guy juggling fire. It's pretty cool!
Alice: Fire juggling? Okay, that sounds exciting! I might have to check that out.
Bob: You should! We could go together.
Alice: That's a great idea! I can be your human shield if the fire gets too close.
Bob: Perfect! And I can help you find the best food stalls. It's a deal!
Alice: Deal! I'm already looking forward to it.
