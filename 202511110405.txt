Alice : Oh, hi Bob! You look a bit... green. Did you have a fun weekend? Bob : Alice! You too. My weekend was an "adventure." I tried glamping. Turns out, 'glamorous camping' still involves dirt and angry squirrels. Alice : Angry squirrels? And here I thought glamping was all about fancy tents and sparkling cider! Bob : Exactly! The website photos showed fluffy beds. My bed was a deflating air mattress. It sounded like a sad whale all night. Alice : Oh, poor Bob! So, no sparkling cider? Bob : No, but I did have a very close encounter with a giant mosquito. We shared my tent. He was not a good listener. Alice : Haha! That sounds terrible! My weekend was much simpler. I just binged a new show about a detective cat. Bob : A detective cat? That sounds way more glamorous than my mosquito roommate. Alice : It was! He solved mysteries and always landed on his feet. Very impressive. Bob : I just wanted to land on a soft mattress! My back feels like I slept on a stack of encyclopedias. Alice : Maybe next time, try a "staycation." Stay home, relax, order pizza. Bob : Pizza and no mosquitoes? That sounds like a dream! I'm taking notes. Alice : Good idea! And remember, 'glamping' is a trap, unless you love nature... and pain. Bob : Lesson learned, Alice. Hard. My next trip will be to my couch. Alice : Perfect! See you next week, hopefully well-rested! Bob : I'll try my best! Bye!
