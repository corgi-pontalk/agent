    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, do you remember where that new coffee shop is?</p>
        <p>Bob: Oh, Alice! Yes, I do! It's super close.</p>
        <p>Alice: Great! My phone battery is dead. Can you tell me?</p>
        <p>Bob: Okay, so you go straight from here.</p>
        <p>Alice: Straight? Like... don't turn?</p>
        <p>Bob: Exactly! Then, you'll see a big, blue building.</p>
        <p>Alice: A blue building... Got it.</p>
        <p>Bob: At the blue building, turn left.</p>
        <p>Alice: Left. My left or your left if you were facing the building?</p>
        <p>Bob: Uh... your left! Always your left. Then walk a little more.</p>
        <p>Alice: Okay, walking. Is it far?</p>
        <p>Bob: No, no. After that left, you'll see a small park. The coffee shop is right across from the park. Maybe turn right after the park?</p>
        <p>Alice: Wait, right after the park? So, left at the blue building, then right after the park?</p>
        <p>Bob: Yes! Or... wait. Is it right or left after the park? My sense of direction is terrible after coffee.</p>
        <p>Alice: Bob! You just had coffee! Maybe I should just follow my nose for coffee beans.</p>
        <p>Bob: Haha, probably a better plan, Alice! But seriously, it's straight, then left, then... maybe right? Or just look for the giant coffee cup sign!</p>
        <p>Alice: I'll look for the giant coffee cup. Thanks for the... adventure, Bob!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <p>For beginners, understanding how to give and ask for directions involves a few simple grammar points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Giving Directions (Imperative Form):</strong> We often use verbs in their base form (imperative) to give direct commands or instructions. This is perfect for directions!
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Go</span> straight.</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Turn</span> left at the corner.</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Walk</span> a little further.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepositions of Place (Simple):</strong> These words tell us about position.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Straight:</span> Means forward, without turning.</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Left/Right:</span> Indicates a direction to your left or right side.</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Across from:</span> Means on the opposite side of something, often with a street or space in between.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Asking for Location (Where is...?):</strong> This is a very common and essential question structure.
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Where is</span> the coffee shop?</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Where is</span> the museum?</li>
                <li><span class="key-phrase">Where is</span> the bathroom?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
