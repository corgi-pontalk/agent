    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, still staring at that chemistry textbook? You look like you just saw a ghost!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! Oh, it's worse than a ghost. It's... atoms! They're everywhere, and I don't get them.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha! Well, you <em>are</em> made of atoms, you know. Everything is!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, this coffee cup? Atoms. My sandwich? Atoms. Even my confusion? Atoms?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! Think of atoms as tiny, tiny building blocks. Super, super small.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, building blocks. Like Lego? Can I build a house with them?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You could, but it would be the smallest house ever! When atoms join together, they make molecules.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Molecules! Is that why water is H2O? Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom make a water molecule?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Ding ding ding! You got it! That's a molecule of water.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, air is also molecules? Like, a bunch of different atoms dancing around?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Pretty much! Mostly nitrogen and oxygen molecules. They're just floating everywhere.</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Wow. So, I'm breathing nitrogen and oxygen molecules right now. And my brain is thinking about atoms... which are also atoms. My head hurts.</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Don't worry, Bob. Chemistry isn't so scary once you understand the basics. It's just about what everything is made of!</p>
    <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, if I understand chemistry, does that mean I can finally turn my homework into pizza?</p>
    <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hmm, not quite, but you might understand <em>why</em> pizza tastes so good! It's all chemistry!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Chemistry might sound like a difficult subject, but it's actually all around us! From the food we eat to the air we breathe, everything is made of chemicals. Understanding basic chemistry helps us understand the world better. For beginners, learning about atoms and molecules is like learning the alphabet of the universe – it's the first step to understanding how everything is put together and how it works.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. The Simple Present Tense (for facts and general truths)</h3>
    <p>We use the simple present tense to talk about things that are always true, facts, or habits.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>"Everything <strong>is</strong>!" (Fact)</li>
                <li>"When atoms <strong>join</strong> together, they <strong>make</strong> molecules." (General truth)</li>
                <li>"Water <strong>is</strong> H2O." (Fact)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Structure</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive</strong>: Subject + Verb (base form) for I, You, We, They. (e.g., <em>I understand, They make</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>Positive (He, She, It)</strong>: Subject + Verb + -s/-es. (e.g., <em>It is, He makes</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>Negative</strong>: Subject + do/does + not + Verb. (e.g., <em>I don't get them.</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>Questions</strong>: Do/Does + Subject + Verb? (e.g., <em>Do you understand? Does it work?</em>)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Using 'So' to show consequence or conclusion</h3>
    <p>'So' is often used to connect ideas, showing that the second part is a result or conclusion of the first part.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>"My sandwich? Atoms. <strong>So</strong>, this coffee cup? Atoms." (Bob is making a conclusion)</li>
                <li>"<strong>So</strong>, air is also molecules?" (Bob is asking if his conclusion is correct)</li>
                <li>"<strong>So</strong>, if I understand chemistry, does that mean I can finally turn my homework into pizza?" (Bob makes a humorous conclusion)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Using 'Everything' and 'Everywhere'</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Everything</strong>: refers to all things. It is a singular pronoun.
            <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "<strong>Everything</strong> is atoms!"</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Everywhere</strong>: refers to all places. It is an adverb.
            <ul><li><em>Example:</em> "They're <strong>everywhere</strong>." "They're just floating <strong>everywhere</strong>."</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
