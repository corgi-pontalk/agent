        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob! How are you doing today? Ready for our English practice?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! Hi! I'm great, thanks. And yes, absolutely! Today I want to learn about emergency English. You know, just in case!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> That's a super important topic! What phrases do you want to start with?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, I was thinking about the really loud ones! Like... <em>[Bob suddenly shouts loudly]</em> "HELP!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Whoa, Bob! Calm down! You only shout "Help!" when you're in real danger or need immediate assistance. Like if you're drowning, or stuck!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, right. Not just for practice. Got it. Okay, how about this? <em>[Whispers dramatically]</em> "Fire!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>[Chuckles]</em> Closer! But again, Bob, that's for when you see actual flames or a lot of smoke. Not for a tiny candle!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hmm, okay. So, not for my burnt toast this morning. And what about... "Police!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Good one! "Police!" is for when there's a crime, like stealing, or if someone is hurt in an accident and you need law enforcement.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> So, if my neighbor's cat is stuck in a tree, I don't shout "Police!"?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>[Laughs]</em> Definitely not "Police!" Maybe "Help!" to a neighbor, or call the local animal rescue!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Okay, okay. I think I get the idea. Be specific! <em>[Suddenly points]</em> Alice, look! Over there!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> What is it, Bob?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It's... it's a <em>small</em> puddle of water in the middle of the sidewalk! It looks like... a small, watery emergency!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>[Sighs, but smiles]</em> Bob, that's just a puddle. Maybe someone spilled their drink.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> But what if someone slips?! What do I shout? "Fire!"? "Police!"? "Help the puddle!"?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> <em>[Pats his arm]</em> No, Bob. For a puddle, you just walk around it. Or say, "Watch out!" But you're right, practice makes perfect. Keep going, you'll get it!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> I will! Thanks, Alice!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Learning basic emergency phrases in English is very important, even for beginners. You never know when you might need to ask for help, whether you're traveling, living in an English-speaking country, or helping someone else. Knowing what to say clearly and quickly can make a big difference in a serious situation.</p>
    <p>Different countries have different emergency telephone numbers (for example, 911 in the USA and Canada, 999 in the UK, and 112 in most of Europe). However, the words "Help!", "Fire!", and "Police!" are universally understood in English-speaking areas. It's crucial to use these words only in real emergencies to avoid wasting valuable resources.</p>

    <div class="key-phrases">
        <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
        <p>Here are some key phrases for emergencies with example sentences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Help!</strong>: "Help! I can't swim!" (Used when you need immediate assistance in a dangerous situation.)</li>
            <li><strong>I need help.</strong> : "I need help. I'm lost." (A more complete sentence to express your need for assistance.)</li>
            <li><strong>Fire!</strong>: "Fire! Get out of the building!" (Used when you see flames or a lot of smoke, indicating a fire.)</li>
            <li><strong>Call the fire department.</strong> : "There's a fire. Call the fire department quickly!" (Instructions to contact the fire service.)</li>
            <li><strong>Police!</strong>: "Police! That man took my wallet!" (Used when you witness a crime or need law enforcement.)</li>
            <li><strong>Call the police.</strong> : "I saw a car accident. Call the police." (Instructions to contact law enforcement.)</li>
            <li><strong>I'm hurt.</strong> : "My leg hurts. I'm hurt." (Used to inform others that you have an injury.)</li>
            <li><strong>I need a doctor.</strong> : "I feel very sick. I need a doctor." (Used when you require medical attention.)</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency!</strong>: "This is an emergency! We need help now!" (A general term to signal a serious and urgent situation.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <p>Understanding these basic grammar points will help you use emergency phrases correctly:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Imperatives (Commands)</h3>
                <p>Imperatives are used to give direct orders, requests, or instructions. In emergencies, they are very common because you need to act quickly and tell people what to do.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structure</strong>: The base form of the verb. Often, there is no subject (like 'you') because it's implied.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Help!</strong> (This is an imperative verb used as an exclamation.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Call</strong> the police!</li>
                            <li><strong>Get out</strong>!</li>
                            <li><strong>Run</strong>!</li>
                            <li><strong>Stop</strong>!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Simple Present Tense (Statements of Fact or Need)</h3>
                <p>The simple present tense is used to describe current situations, facts, or things that are happening now. In emergencies, you use it to explain what is happening or what you need.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Subject + base form of the verb (add '-s' for he/she/it). For "to be" verb: Subject + am/is/are.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>I need</strong> help. (I = subject, need = base verb)</li>
                            <li><strong>There is</strong> a fire. (There = subject, is = 'to be' verb)</li>
                            <li><strong>I am</strong> hurt. (I = subject, am = 'to be' verb)</li>
                            <li><strong>She is</strong> lost. (She = subject, is = 'to be' verb)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Verb "To Be" (am / is / are)</h3>
                <p>This is one of the most important verbs in English. It helps you describe your state, location, or the state of a situation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>I am</strong> lost.</li>
                            <li><strong>You are</strong> safe now.</li>
                            <li><strong>He is</strong> in danger.</li>
                            <li><strong>It is</strong> an emergency.</li>
                            <li><strong>We are</strong> okay.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
