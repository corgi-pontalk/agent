Alice : Hey, Bob! What are you doing? Bob : Oh, hi Alice! Just thinking about dinner. I'm craving pizza! Alice : Pizza! My favorite! What kind do you like? Bob : I really like Hawaiian pizza. Pineapple is delicious! Alice : *Gasps dramatically* Pineapple... on pizza? Alice, how can you say that?! Bob : Haha, Bob! Don't be so dramatic! I think it's great! Sweet and salty. Alice : No, no, no. I strongly dislike pineapple on pizza. It's a crime! I prefer classic pepperoni or mushroom. Bob : Well, everyone has different tastes, right? What else do you dislike? Alice : Hmm... I really dislike doing laundry. It's so boring! Bob : Oh, I agree! I don't like doing chores much either. But I actually like doing laundry sometimes, it's peaceful. Alice : Peaceful? You're strange, Alice. What do you like besides pineapple pizza and laundry? Bob : I love reading books, especially fantasy stories. And I enjoy hiking in the mountains. Alice : Hiking? That's cool! I like watching movies, especially action movies. And I love playing video games all weekend. Bob : Aha! So you like sitting on the couch and playing games, but you dislike doing laundry? Sounds like Bob! Alice : Hey! It's exercise for my thumbs! What about food? Any other dislikes? Bob : I really dislike eating very spicy food. My tongue goes numb! Alice : Oh, really? I love spicy food! The hotter, the better! Bob : Of course you do, Bob. You like anything that makes you sweat! Alice : Guilty as charged! So, pizza tonight? But no pineapple for me, please! Bob : Deal! We can order two different kinds. Maybe one for my strange taste and one for your... normal taste. Alice : Perfect! I like that plan. Bob : Me too! See? We can still be friends, even with our strange likes and dislikes. Alice : Definitely! See you later, Alice! Bob : Bye, Bob!
