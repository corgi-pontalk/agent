Alice: Hey Bob, what's got you so buzzed this morning? Did you win the lottery?
Bob: Alice! Even better! I just read that the EU enlargement plans are really gaining traction! Imagine, more countries joining the club!
Alice: Oh, really? Another country joining the club? I thought the waiting list was longer than my grocery list on a Sunday afternoon. What's "on the cards" this time?
Bob: Well, they're talking about bringing in several new members, like the Western Balkans and even Ukraine and Moldova! It's a huge shift!
Alice: Ukraine and Moldova? Wow. Bigger usually means more bureaucracy, Bob. Are we ready for more paperwork, more translations, and more debates about agricultural subsidies?
Bob: Come on, Alice, think of the possibilities! More cultural exchange, a stronger geopolitical bloc, maybe even cheaper phone roaming across more countries!
Alice: Cheaper roaming *is* a strong argument, I'll give you that. But what about the economic impact? And the inevitable "red tape" involved in integrating new economies?
Bob: They'll figure it out! It's all about political will, isn't it? The vision is a larger, more unified Europe! Think of the new markets!
Alice: New markets, or just more people for existing members to subsidize? I'm just hoping they sort out the existing issues first before expanding the pie.
Bob: You're such a pragmatist! But they say it's about sharing prosperity and increasing stability. Plus, new holiday destinations without pesky border controls!
Alice: You're just thinking about your next vacation, aren't you? What about the actual challenges, like corruption in candidate countries or integrating vastly different legal systems?
Bob: Details, details! The general sentiment is that it's high time. After years of discussion, it seems like real progress is *on the cards* now, largely due to recent geopolitical events.
Alice: *On the cards*, eh? Well, let's hope it's not just another really long committee meeting that accomplishes nothing. I'd like to see actual reforms.
Bob: Always the realist, Alice! But a bit of optimism never hurt anyone, especially when we're talking about expanding the world's largest single market!
Alice: Fair enough, Bob. Just make sure you read the fine print before you start packing your bags for the newest member state. I hear the accession process is quite a journey.
