Alice: Oh, Bob, you look a bit green! Are you okay?
Bob: Hi Alice. Not really. I think I've caught something.
Alice: Oh no! A cold? A flu?
Bob: I don't know. My throat is a little sore, and I keep sneezing.
Alice: Hmm, sounds like a cold. Did you take any medicine?
Bob: Not yet. I hate taking pills. They're so big!
Alice: You big baby! You need to take care of yourself. Maybe a pain reliever?
Bob: I was hoping a big slice of pizza would fix it.
Alice: Pizza is not medicine, Bob! You should drink lots of water and get some rest.
Bob: But I have so much to do! Like watching my new show...
Alice: No, rest is important for your recovery. Do you have a fever?
Bob: I don't think so. I feel a bit warm, but no thermometer.
Alice: You should check! Maybe you need to see a doctor if it gets worse.
Bob: A doctor? For a sniffle? No way! They'll tell me to eat vegetables.
Alice: Well, eating healthy is good for your immune system, you know.
Bob: So, no more pizza for my immune system?
Alice: Moderation, Bob! And maybe some vitamin C. Orange juice?
Bob: Okay, fine. Orange juice sounds better than a pill.
Alice: Good. And remember to wash your hands often to prevent spreading germs.
Bob: Oh, right! I don't want to make anyone else sick.
Alice: Exactly. Being healthy isn't just about feeling good, it's about being responsible.
Bob: You're right. Maybe I'll go home and take a nap.
Alice: That's a good idea! And try to avoid sugary drinks for now.
Bob: No soda? This is a tough recovery.
Alice: Think of it as a health challenge! You can do it.
Bob: Okay, okay. Thanks for the advice, Dr. Alice.
Alice: Anytime, patient Bob! Just get well soon.
Bob: I'll try my best. And maybe I'll eat an apple tomorrow.
Alice: One apple a day keeps the doctor away, they say!
