        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, Bob! Fancy meeting you here! Are you actually in a <em>physical</em> bookstore? I thought your natural habitat was somewhere with free Wi-Fi and unlimited coffee.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, good to see you! And yes, I'm just... researching. Gathering intelligence from the enemy's camp, if you will. I'm on the cusp of something big, you see.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: "Enemy's camp"? What on earth are you talking about? And "on the cusp of something big" usually means you've discovered a new flavor of instant ramen.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Ha! Very funny. No, this is much grander. I'm finally taking the plunge and self-publishing my book!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Your book? Wait, is this the philosophical treatise from your cat, Chairman Meow? I thought that was a joke!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A joke? Alice, Chairman Meow's insights into the existential dread of a tuna-free diet are profound! And in the digital era, there are no more gatekeepers. I can upload it tonight!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: No gatekeepers... so no editors, no proofreaders, no actual human beings to say, "Bob, perhaps Chairman Meow's 'Ode to a Sunbeam' needs a stronger narrative arc"?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Details, details! It's about raw, authentic voice! Plus, digital publishing is so much more accessible. My entire library fits in my pocket, and now Chairman Meow's wisdom can too!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I guess that's convenient. But isn't the market completely saturated? There must be a million self-published cat memoirs out there. How will Chairman Meow stand out from the crowd?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Ah, that's where my marketing genius comes in. Social media, cat influencer partnerships, maybe even a TikTok dance challenge featuring Chairman Meow himself! We're building a brand!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: So, you're telling me you've been spending weeks crafting hashtags instead of, you know, paragraphs?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: It's a holistic approach, Alice! Besides, traditional publishing is such a slow grind. Rejection after rejection, then years for it to hit the shelves. I want instant gratification!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I suppose. But there's just something about holding a physical book, isn't there? The smell of the paper, the satisfying weight...</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Sentimental fluff! Give me a backlit screen and adjustable font size any day. Plus, my carbon pawprint is practically zero with e-books!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: "Carbon pawprint." Right. Well, good luck with Chairman Meow, Bob. I hope he goes viral for all the right reasons.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: He will! And when I'm a digital publishing mogul, I'll send you a free e-copy. Consider it a collector's item!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, joy. My digital shelf eagerly awaits.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>The digital era has fundamentally reshaped the book publishing industry, ushering in a period of unprecedented change and innovation. Traditionally, authors relied on literary agents and publishing houses to bring their works to print. This system, while ensuring a certain level of quality control, was often slow, selective, and difficult for new voices to penetrate.</p>
        <p>Today, technology has democratized publishing. E-books and audiobooks have become mainstream, offering readers convenience, portability, and often lower prices. Platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, Apple Books, and Kobo Writing Life allow authors to bypass traditional gatekeepers entirely, enabling them to self-publish their works directly to a global audience. Print-on-demand services further blur the lines, allowing authors to offer physical copies without the need for large print runs or warehousing.</p>
        <p>This shift has empowered countless independent authors and niche genres to find their readers. However, it also presents challenges: the market is now flooded with content, making discoverability difficult for new titles. While accessibility is high, maintaining quality control (editing, proofreading, cover design) often falls solely on the author, which can impact the reader experience. Despite these challenges, digital publishing continues to evolve, offering dynamic new pathways for storytelling and consumption.</p>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

        <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "I've been working")</h3>
        <p>This tense is used to describe an action that started in the past and is still continuing in the present, or has recently stopped but has a clear connection to the present. It emphasizes the duration of the action.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure</strong>: <code>Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing</code></li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue</strong>: "So, you're telling me you've been spending weeks crafting hashtags..." (Alice asks about Bob's ongoing activity.)</li>
            <li><strong>Another example</strong>: "I've been learning English for two years." (The learning started in the past and continues.)</li>
            <li><strong>Contrast with Present Perfect Simple</strong>: The Present Perfect Simple ("I have worked") focuses on the completed action or the result, while the Present Perfect Continuous ("I have been working") emphasizes the activity itself and its duration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and a preposition or adverb (or both) that create a new meaning different from the original verb. They are very common in spoken and informal English.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Examples from dialogue</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>take the plunge</strong>: To decide to do something important or risky. (e.g., "He finally decided to take the plunge and start his own business.")</li>
                    <li><strong>stand out (from the crowd)</strong>: To be noticeable or different from others. (e.g., "Her bright red dress made her stand out at the party.")</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>More common phrasal verbs</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>look up</strong>: to search for information (e.g., "I'll look up the word in the dictionary.")</li>
                    <li><strong>give up</strong>: to stop trying (e.g., "Don't give up on your dreams!")</li>
                    <li><strong>run out of</strong>: to have no more of something (e.g., "We've run out of milk.")</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Conditional Sentences (Type 1)</h3>
        <p>Conditional sentences describe a cause-and-effect relationship. Type 1 conditionals talk about a real or very probable situation in the future.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure</strong>: <code>If + Subject + Simple Present, Subject + will + Base Verb</code></li>
            <li><strong>Example from dialogue</strong>: "And when I'm a digital publishing mogul, I'll send you a free e-copy." (If he becomes a mogul, then he will send the copy.)</li>
            <li><strong>Another example</strong>: "If it rains tomorrow, we will stay home." (It's possible it will rain, and if so, we'll stay home.)</li>
            <li><strong>Usage</strong>: Used for predictions, plans, promises, or warnings about future events.</li>
        </ul>
