Alice: Bob! That meeting was a disaster! My brain feels like scrambled eggs.
Bob: Oh, Alice, tell me about it. My head is still spinning. Did we even achieve anything?
Alice: Seriously! "Let's touch base offline"? What does that even mean? Are we playing tag?
Bob: Haha, not quite. It means talk later, outside the meeting. People love to sound fancy.
Alice: And "circle back on this next week"? Did we forget something important in a circle?
Bob: That's just a polite way to say "we'll discuss it again later." They usually want to avoid making a decision *now*.
Alice: It felt like everyone was speaking a secret code! I just nodded and smiled a lot, hoping nobody would ask me anything.
Bob: I know the feeling. Sometimes I pretend to take notes, but I'm really just doodling funny monsters.
Alice: So, any tips for our *next* meeting? I don't want to get lost in translation again. I hate feeling clueless.
Bob: Definitely. Try to learn some common meeting phrases. Like "I agree" or "I have a question." Simple stuff first.
Alice: Good idea. And what if I don't understand something? Can I just ask?
Bob: Absolutely! You can say, "Could you please explain that?" or "Could you repeat that, please?" It’s better to ask than to guess wrong.
Alice: That sounds less scary. I thought I had to understand everything perfectly or look silly.
Bob: Nobody does, Alice. English meetings often use very specific business jargon. Even native speakers get confused sometimes!
Alice: Okay, Bob. Next meeting, I'm bringing my dictionary... and maybe a phrasebook! Wish me luck!
Bob: Good luck! Let's touch base after it to see how it went. Don't forget your monster drawings!
