    <h2>Dialogue</h2>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, hey! What are you doing with that banana peel?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, hi Alice! I was just about to put it in... the garbage.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: The <strong>garbage</strong>? Bob, we have a compost bin! Don't you remember the big green one?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, right! The one that smells like... future soil? My bad. I always forget which bin is for what.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It's okay. It takes practice! And this plastic bottle? This goes in the blue recycling bin.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Blue bin, got it. So, green for bananas, blue for bottles... What about this old shoe?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: A shoe? Hmm, that's tricky. Not recycling, not compost. Maybe donation? Or just regular trash if it's really broken.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Sustainability is hard work! My head is spinning with all these rules.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It's not <em>that</em> hard. Just think: <strong>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle!</strong></p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Reduce... my coffee intake? Reuse... this coffee cup for water? Recycle... my socks?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (Laughs) You're trying! Reduce means use less new stuff. Reuse means use things again. Like your coffee cup!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, so my reusable coffee cup is a superhero!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! And when you shop, remember your <strong>reusable bag</strong>. No plastic bags, please!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right. Reusable bag... I left mine in the car. Oops.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It's a learning process. Every small step helps <strong>save the planet</strong>.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So, no more putting glass bottles in the paper recycling bin?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Definitely not! That's a big no-no.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Got it. Green for future soil, blue for plastic, no glass with paper, and my coffee cup is a superhero. I think I'm getting it!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Good job, Bob! Now, let's find that compost bin for your banana peel.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>
        Recycling and sustainability are very important today because our planet has a lot of trash. When we recycle, we turn old things into new ones, which saves natural resources and energy. Sustainability means living in a way that helps the Earth for a long time. Many countries have different bins for plastic, paper, glass, and compost. It can be confusing, but every little effort helps reduce pollution and protect nature.
