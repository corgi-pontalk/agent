        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, Bob! Is that you? I didn't expect to see you here!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! My hero! Yes, it's me. I'm on a quest for the legendary 'Cold Slayer' medicine. My nose feels like a leaky faucet, and my head is a drum solo.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A 'Cold Slayer'? Are you sure it's not just a regular cold? You always get so dramatic.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Dramatic? This is serious, Alice! I need something for my sore throat, too. It feels like I swallowed a cactus.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Okay, okay. Let's find something. Have you asked the pharmacist for advice?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Not yet. I was admiring the colorful bandages. Do you think a glittery one would make me feel better?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Probably not for a sore throat, Bob. Look, there's the pharmacist. Let's go ask her.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: But what should I say? My voice is so hoarse!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Just tell her your symptoms. "Hello, I have a sore throat and a runny nose." Easy.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Right. "Hello, kind dispenser of healing elixirs! My nasal passages are in rebellion and my vocal cords are staging a protest!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (whispering) Bob, just "Hello, I have a sore throat and a runny nose."</p>
        <p><strong>Pharmacist</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: (clears throat dramatically) Yes, I have a sore throat and a runny nose, and my head...</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (interjecting smoothly) And he's looking for some medicine for a common cold. Something for the throat and nose.</p>
        <p><strong>Pharmacist</strong>: I see. We have a good syrup for sore throats and nasal sprays for runny noses. Would you like a pain reliever for your head too?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A pain reliever! Yes! My head is a rock concert!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (to Bob) Okay, let's get the syrup, the spray, and some pain relievers. You'll be fine.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Thank you, Alice. You saved my life. Or at least my weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You're welcome. And next time, maybe just a cough drop for your 'cactus throat'.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>A pharmacy, sometimes called a drugstore, is a place where you can buy medicines. There are two main types of medicines: 'prescription medicines' (which you need a doctor's note for) and 'over-the-counter' medicines (which you can buy freely). At a pharmacy, you can talk to a pharmacist, who is a trained professional who can give you advice about medicines and minor health issues. Besides medicine, many pharmacies also sell things like first-aid supplies (bandages, antiseptic), toiletries (soap, shampoo), and even snacks or drinks. When you're not feeling well, the pharmacy is a great place to get help for common problems like a cold, a headache, or a small cut.</p>
