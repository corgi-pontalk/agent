    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, what's got you looking like you just won the lottery?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! You won't believe what I was just thinking about – the future of cars!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no, not your flying car obsession again. Are we talking about a vehicle that <em>actually</em> flies, or just one that hovers slightly over potholes?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, eventually actual flying cars! Imagine, no more traffic jams, just soaring over everyone! But think about self-driving cars too. Your car could pick you up, drive you to work while you sleep, and even park itself perfectly.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That sounds suspiciously like a fancy alarm clock with wheels. What if it decides to take a detour to the nearest donut shop? My car has excellent taste, I'm just saying.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Haha, well, hopefully it would prioritize your schedule over its cravings! And imagine cars as mobile offices or even mini-apartments. You could have a full meeting on the way to a client!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, my car becomes my new, even smaller, workspace? Sounds less like a revolution and more like a very expensive cubicle on wheels. What about the ultimate convenience – a car that makes you coffee?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Oh, absolutely! Integrated espresso machines, mini-fridges, maybe even a built-in massage chair! You'd never want to leave.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: And who would clean it? My robot butler? Because I highly doubt my car will self-clean after I spill my hypothetical self-made coffee.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Details, details! I'm sure there'd be auto-cleaning modes, or maybe drone-based cleaning services. Or maybe cars will be made of self-cleaning material.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Self-cleaning cars that fly and make coffee... Bob, are you sure you didn't just invent a very expensive, very lazy, very caffeinated living room?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: A <em>mobile</em> living room! And think about the environmental benefits! Electric, zero emissions, maybe even powered by solar roads!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Solar roads? You mean the ones that would get covered in dirt and leaves five minutes after installation? I'm picturing a very elaborate, very slow, very expensive sunbath.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Okay, maybe we'll stick to super-efficient batteries for now. But imagine personalized AI assistants in every car, anticipating your needs before you even realize them!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, my car would know I need to stop for gas before I do? Or remind me I'm low on snacks? That's just creepy, Bob. I like to be surprised by my own hunger.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It's convenience, Alice! The future is all about effortless living! No more driving stress, just pure relaxation and productivity.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: I don't know, Bob. Part of me thinks the future of cars will just be slightly smarter versions of what we have now, but with even more confusing touchscreen menus. And a subscription for heated seats.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: You're such a cynic! But okay, a subscription for heated seats is probably a grim reality. Still, I'm optimistic! Maybe we'll get flying skateboards too!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Dream big, Bob. Dream big. Just make sure your flying skateboard has a designated landing strip in my backyard.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The automotive industry is currently undergoing a massive transformation, moving rapidly towards a future that looks significantly different from the past century of car manufacturing. Several key trends are shaping this evolution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Electric Vehicles (EVs):</strong> The shift from internal combustion engines to electric powertrains is accelerating globally. Governments are setting ambitious emissions targets, and battery technology is improving, leading to longer ranges and faster charging times. Many major manufacturers are phasing out petrol and diesel models.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Driving (Self-Driving Cars):</strong> While fully autonomous vehicles (Level 5) are still some way off for widespread public use, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking are becoming standard. Companies are extensively testing self-driving taxis and delivery services in controlled environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Cars are becoming increasingly connected, communicating with other vehicles (V2V), infrastructure (V2I), and even pedestrians (V2P), collectively known as V2X technology. This connectivity enables real-time traffic updates, remote diagnostics, over-the-air software updates, and enhanced safety features.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Mobility:</strong> Services like ride-sharing, car-sharing, and subscription models are gaining popularity, challenging the traditional model of individual car ownership, especially in urban areas. This trend aligns with sustainability goals and reduces the number of vehicles on the road.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability and New Materials:</strong> Beyond electric power, the industry is focusing on sustainable manufacturing processes, lightweighting vehicles for efficiency, and using recycled or bio-based materials in interiors and exteriors.</li>
        <li><strong>AI and Personalization:</strong> Artificial intelligence is being integrated into vehicles for everything from advanced infotainment systems and voice assistants to predictive maintenance and personalized driving experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The future of automobiles promises not just new ways of getting around, but a redefinition of what a car is, moving towards a more integrated, sustainable, and intelligent mobility ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Future Tenses: "Will" vs. "Be Going To"</h3>
        <p>Both "will" and "be going to" are used to talk about the future, but they often convey slightly different meanings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Will</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Used for predictions or general statements about the future (often based on opinion, not strong evidence).
                        <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"My car <strong>will</strong> self-clean after I spill my coffee." (Prediction/Opinion)</em></span></li>
                    <li>For spontaneous decisions made at the moment of speaking.
                        <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"I'll help you with that right now." (Spontaneous decision)</em></span></li>
                    <li>For promises or offers.
                        <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"I <strong>will</strong> always support your dreams." (Promise)</em></span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Be Going To</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Used for plans or intentions that have already been decided.
                        <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"I'm <strong>going to</strong> buy an electric car next year." (Pre-planned intention)</em></span></li>
                    <li>For predictions based on present evidence (something you can see or know now).
                        <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"Look at those dark clouds! It's <strong>going to</strong> rain." (Prediction based on evidence)</em></span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Future Possibility/Prediction: "Could" and "Would"</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs add nuance to future statements, expressing possibility, hypothetical situations, or typical behavior in the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Could</strong>: Expresses possibility or ability in the future.
                <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"Your car <strong>could</strong> pick you up and drive you to work." (It's possible it has this ability.)</em></span></li>
            <li><strong>Would</strong>: Expresses a hypothetical or imagined future situation, often in conditional sentences (e.g., if X happened, then Y would happen). Also used for polite requests or typical behavior.
                <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"Hopefully, it <strong>would</strong> prioritize your schedule over its cravings." (Hypothetical situation if the car had cravings.)</em></span>
                <br><span class="example-sentence"><em>"You'd never want to leave." (In a hypothetical future, this would be your desire.)</em></span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Compound Nouns / Adjectives</h3>
        <p>Many terms related to technology and the future are formed by combining two or more words. These can function as nouns or adjectives.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compound Nouns</strong>: Two nouns put together to form a new noun.
                <br><span class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Traffic jams</strong>, <strong>espresso machines</strong>, <strong>landing strip</strong>, <strong>robot butler</strong>.</em></span></li>
            <li><strong>Compound Adjectives</strong>: Often formed with a present participle (-ing) or past participle (-ed) and another word, describing a noun. Hyphenated when they precede the noun they modify.
                <br><span class="example-sentence"><em><strong>Self-driving</strong> cars, <strong>auto-cleaning</strong> modes, <strong>drone-based</strong> cleaning services, <strong>self-cleaning</strong> material.</em></span>
                <br><span class="note">(Note: When these appear after the noun, the hyphen is often dropped, e.g., "The car is self-driving.")</em></span></li>
        </ul>
