Alice : Oh no, Bob, look at the time! We're going to be so late for the party! Bob : Relax, Alice! We can just grab a taxi. It’ll be quick. Alice : But where is one? I don't see any around here! Bob : Hmm, let me open my taxi app... Oh, wait. My phone battery is super low! Alice : Seriously? Bob, you _always_ do this! Now what? Bob : Okay, okay! Plan B: we'll hail one. Just wave your arm like *this*! (Bob waves his arm wildly, looking a bit like he's swatting a giant invisible mosquito) Alice : Bob, that's not how you hail a taxi! You look like you're trying to fly away! Bob : Well, it's a very urgent flight! Anyway, how *do* you do it? Alice : You need to stand closer to the curb and make eye contact with the driver. Look, there's one coming! Quick, try again! Bob : Okay, okay! (He steps forward and waves his hand more clearly.) Taxi! Hey! Alice : Good, he saw us! Quick, get in before he changes his mind! Bob : (To driver) Excuse me, driver, can you take us to the Grand Hotel, please? Driver : Sure thing. Hop in. Alice : (Whispering to Bob) Thanks for saving us, Bob, even with your... unique technique. Bob : (Grinning) Hey, it worked! Next time, I'll teach you the 'Bob's super-taxi-hailing-dance'. Alice : (Sighs dramatically) Please don't. Just charge your phone.
