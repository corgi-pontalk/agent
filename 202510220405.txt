Alice: Oh, Bob, you look like you've seen a ghost! What's up?
Bob: Alice! You won't believe it. I just saw the tallest man ever!
Alice: Taller than you? That's not hard, you're not exactly a skyscraper yourself, Bob! _(teasing)_
Bob: Hey! I'm average! But this guy... he was really tall. Like, super tall.
Alice: How tall is "super tall"? Was he taller than a door frame?
Bob: Almost! And he had bright red hair. Like a fiery sunset!
Alice: Red hair, huh? Was it long or short?
Bob: It was short , a bit spiky. And he had a funny little mustache.
Alice: A mustache AND red, spiky hair? Sounds like a character from a cartoon!
Bob: Exactly! Then I saw a woman with him. She was quite short.
Alice: Short? Or just short compared to the giant?
Bob: Good point! Next to him, she looked tiny. And she had long, dark brown hair. Very shiny.
Alice: So, a tall, red-haired man and a short-looking woman with long, dark brown hair. Sounds like a fun pair!
Bob: They were holding hands! Anyway, what about our friend, Mark? How would you describe him?
Alice: Oh, Mark! He's not very tall, more on the short side. And he has blonde hair , usually a bit messy.
Bob: Haha, yes, messy blonde hair is Mark's signature look! And he wears glasses.
Alice: Right! And a really nice smile.
