    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: Hi Bob! Are we finally here? This hotel looks... interesting.</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! Yes, we made it! Don't worry, I'm an expert at hotel check-ins. Watch and learn.</p>
        <p>Alice: Oh, really? An expert? Last time, you tried to check into a clothes store.</p>
        <p>Bob: That was a *very* fancy boutique! Anyway, first, we need the "reception desk." It's like the hotel's brain.</p>
        <p>Alice: I see the sign. Let's go.</p>
        <p>Bob: Good morning! We have a reservation. My name is... (mumbles) Bob.</p>
        <p>Hotel Staff: Good morning. Can I have your last name, please?</p>
        <p>Bob: Uh, Johnson! Bob Johnson. And my friend, Alice. We booked a room.</p>
        <p>Hotel Staff: Let me check. Ah, Bob Johnson, one room for two nights. Is that correct?</p>
        <p>Alice: Yes, that's perfect!</p>
        <p>Hotel Staff: Great. Could I please have your ID and a credit card for the deposit?</p>
        <p>Bob: ID... credit card... Uh oh. I think my wallet is still in the car. Alice, do you have yours?</p>
        <p>Alice: (Sighs dramatically) Bob, the "expert." Here's my card. Next time, *I'll* be the expert.</p>
        <p>Hotel Staff: Thank you. Here are your key cards, Mr. Johnson. Your room number is 402. Enjoy your stay!</p>
        <p>Bob: Room 402! See, Alice? Smooth as silk... almost. Let's find our room!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>When you arrive at a hotel, the first thing you do is "check in." This means you officially tell the hotel you are there and get your room key. You usually go to the "reception desk" (also called the front desk). The staff there will ask for your name to find your "reservation" (the booking you made earlier). They might also ask for your "ID" (identification, like a passport or driver's license) and a "credit card" for a "deposit" (money the hotel holds in case of damages or extra costs). After they confirm everything, they will give you a "key card" (an electronic card to open your room) and tell you your "room number." It's a common and important process for travelers!</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="key-phrase-item"><strong>We have a reservation.</strong>
            <p><em>Meaning:</em> We booked a room before arriving.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> "Good evening! <strong>We have a reservation</strong> under the name Smith."</p>
        </li>
        <li class="key-phrase-item"><strong>My name is [name].</strong>
            <p><em>Meaning:</em> Stating your full name to the hotel staff.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> "Hello, <strong>my name is</strong> Sarah Miller. I booked a single room."</p>
        </li>
        <li class="key-phrase-item"><strong>Can I have your last name, please?</strong> / <strong>Could I please have your ID/credit card?</strong>
            <p><em>Meaning:</em> Polite ways for the staff to ask for your information.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> "<strong>Can I have your last name, please?</strong>" "<strong>Could I please have your ID</strong> and a credit card?"</p>
        </li>
        <li class="key-phrase-item"><strong>Is that correct?</strong>
            <p><em>Meaning:</em> Asking if the information heard or stated is accurate.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> "You have a room for three nights, <strong>is that correct?</strong>"</p>
        </li>
        <li class="key-phrase-item"><strong>Key card</strong> / <strong>Room number</strong>
            <p><em>Meaning:</em> The electronic card to open your hotel room and the specific number of your room.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> "Here is your <strong>key card</strong>. Your <strong>room number</strong> is 705."</p>
        </li>
        <li class="key-phrase-item"><strong>Enjoy your stay!</strong>
            <p><em>Meaning:</em> A polite farewell from the staff, wishing you a pleasant time at the hotel.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> "Welcome to our hotel. <strong>Enjoy your stay!</strong>"</p>
        </li>
        <li class="key-phrase-item"><strong>Reception desk</strong> / <strong>Front desk</strong>
            <p><em>Meaning:</em> The main counter in the hotel lobby where guests check in, check out, and ask for help.</p>
            <p><em>Example:</em> "Let's go to the <strong>reception desk</strong> to check in."</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Simple Present Tense for Routines and Facts</h3>
        <p>We use the simple present tense to talk about things that are always true, or actions that happen regularly or are part of a routine.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"It <strong>is</strong> like the hotel's brain." (Fact)</li>
            <li>"We <strong>have</strong> a reservation." (Fact/Current state)</li>
            <li>"My name <strong>is</strong> Bob." (Fact)</li>
            <li>"I <strong>think</strong> my wallet is in the car." (Regular thought/belief)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + Verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it)</p>
        <p><em>Examples:</em> I go, You go, He goes, She goes, It goes, We go, They go.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Making Polite Requests: "Can I have..." / "Could I please have..."</h3>
        <p>These phrases are used to ask for something politely. "Could I please have..." is slightly more formal or polite than "Can I have..." They are essential when interacting with hotel staff.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"<strong>Can I have</strong> your last name, please?"</li>
            <li>"<strong>Could I please have</strong> your ID and a credit card?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Can/Could + I + have + [object] + (please)?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Confirming Information: "Is that correct?"</h3>
        <p>This phrase is used to check if the information you have is accurate. It's very useful when dealing with bookings or personal details to avoid mistakes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"One room for two nights. <strong>Is that correct?</strong>"</li>
            <li>"Your flight is at 3 PM, <strong>is that correct?</strong>"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Structure:</strong> [Statement], is that correct?</p>
    </div>
