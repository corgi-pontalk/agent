Bob : Alice, you won't believe what I just read about 'The International' prize pool! Alice : 'The International'? Is that like the Olympics, but for... finger dexterity? Bob : Haha, close! It's the biggest Dota 2 tournament, and this year, the prize pool hit like40 million. Forty! Million! Dollars! Alice : Wait, people earn that much from playing video games? My mom always told me gaming was a waste of time! Bob : Tell her the esports arena is the new corporate boardroom! These pros train like Olympic athletes. Their reaction times are insane. Alice : So, they're basically rockstar nerds? Are there stadiums full of screaming fans for this? Bob : Absolutely! Packed arenas, massive screens, commentators, dazzling light shows. It's a full-blown spectacle. A global phenomenon doesn't even begin to cover it. Alice : Wow, I thought it was just people yelling into headsets in their basements. Is it truly global? Bob : Totally global! Teams from Korea, Europe, China, North America... The competitive gaming scene is worldwide. There are even pro gaming leagues with regular seasons. Alice : So, which games are the big ones? Is it all shooting games, or are there strategy ones too? Bob : Oh, it's a huge variety of titles. Dota 2, League of Legends, CS:GO, Valorant, Overwatch, even fighting games like Street Fighter. Strategy, shooters, MOBAs – you name it. Alice : I tried League of Legends once. My kill-death ratio was so bad, I think I actually owed the enemy team kills. Bob : Haha, it takes practice! But seriously, esports viewership rivals traditional sports now. Brands are pouring money into it. Alice : So, if I start practicing my Mario Kart skills now, do you think I could be a millionaire by next year? Or maybe just a competitive amateur? Bob : Dream big, Alice! But maybe start with a less chaotic game first. The path to pro is long, but who knows? We could be watching *you* in a global arena someday!
