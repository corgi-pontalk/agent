Alice : Bob, guess what! I just had an amazing idea! Bob : Alice! What's up? You look like you just saw a giant, talking squirrel! Alice : No, silly! Even better! I'm going to bake the biggest cookie in the world! Bob : A giant cookie? You mean, like, a cookie the size of a car tire? Alice : Exactly! I need a lot of chocolate chips and a really, really big oven. Bob : Do you have the special recipe from your grandma? You know, the one with the secret ingredient? Alice : Oh, the secret ingredient! I almost forgot! It's just a pinch of cinnamon, but it makes a big difference. It's an old family secret! Bob : Can I help? I can be a taste tester. Or maybe a chief flour sifter! Alice : You? A chief flour sifter? Last time you tried to bake, you mistook flour for sugar and made a very salty cake. Bob : Hey, that was an accident! I was tired. I promise I'll be a good helper this time. I even brought a new apron! Alice : Hmm, okay. We'll need an egg and a cup of milk first. And the measuring spoons. Bob : Got it! Where's the milk? Oh, wait, is it the milk in the red carton or the blue carton? Alice : The red one, Bob! The one that says "whole milk." Don't grab a random carton! Bob : Okay, got it! This is going to be a legendary cookie. I'll get the egg. Alice : Let's hope so! Or it will be a very expensive, very salty mistake. Wish us luck!
