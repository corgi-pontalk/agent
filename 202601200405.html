    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, did you notice how warm it is today?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! I was just thinking that! It's December, but I'm sweating!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Right? My ice cream melted before I even left the store. This climate change thing is no joke.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Yeah, it’s getting a bit crazy. I tried to walk to work this morning, but then I saw a hot dog stand and just... got a taxi.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha! So much for reducing your carbon footprint!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Hey, I carried my own reusable bag for the hot dog! Small steps, Alice, small steps.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: True. I actually bought one of those "eco-friendly" water bottles. It's so big, my backpack looks like it's carrying a small whale.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: At least you’re trying! I tried to turn off all the lights at home yesterday, but then I couldn't find my socks. It was a dark, sockless adventure.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh no! Did you use your phone's flashlight?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Of course! And then my phone battery died. So I just went to bed early. Mission accomplished?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha, kind of! At least you saved <em>some</em> energy.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! What else can we do, besides having early, dark bedtime adventures?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, we could try to eat less meat? Or plant a tree.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Planting a tree sounds nice. But do they sell tiny trees for city apartments?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe a cactus? It's green and doesn't need much water!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A climate change cactus! I like it! Let's get one tomorrow.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Sounds like a plan, Bob! Maybe we'll save the world, one cactus at a time.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: And one dark, sockless adventure!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Climate change means our Earth's weather is changing in strange ways. We often see hotter summers, unusual cold snaps, or more storms. This is happening because of human activities. When we burn fuels for cars, factories, and electricity, it releases gases into the air. These gases trap heat and make our planet warmer. This global warming affects animals, plants, and people everywhere, making it a very important topic for everyone to understand and act on.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Simple (for facts and habits)</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about things that are always true, facts, or habits (things we do regularly).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fact</strong>: "It <em>is</em> December." (The current month is December.)</li>
            <li><strong>Habit</strong>: "I <em>try</em> to walk to work." (This is something Bob usually does.)</li>
            <li><strong>General Truth</strong>: "My ice cream <em>melted</em>." (When it's warm, ice cream melts.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: base verb (I/You/We/They) or base verb + -s/-es (He/She/It)</p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Examples: "The Earth <strong>gets</strong> warmer." "I usually <strong>walk</strong>."</p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Present Continuous (for ongoing actions or temporary situations)</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>We use the Present Continuous for actions happening now, at this moment, or for temporary situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Action happening now</strong>: "I'm <em>sweating</em>!" (Bob is sweating right now.)</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary situation</strong>: "It’s <em>getting</em> a bit crazy." (The situation is changing/becoming crazy.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <em>am / is / are + verb-ing</em></p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Examples: "The climate <strong>is changing</strong>." "We <strong>are learning</strong> English."</p>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Adjectives (for description)</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns (people, places, things, ideas). They tell us more about something.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>warm</strong> (describes temperature): "It's so <em>warm</em> today."</li>
            <li><strong>crazy</strong> (describes a situation): "It's getting a bit <em>crazy</em>."</li>

            <li><strong>nice</strong> (describes quality): "Planting a tree sounds <em>nice</em>."</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="example-sentence">Examples: "The weather is <strong>hot</strong>." "This is an <strong>important</strong> topic."</p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Modal Verbs "Can" and "Could" (for ability and suggestions)</h3>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <p><strong>Can</strong>: Used to express ability (what someone is able to do) or possibility.</p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: "What else <em>can</em> we do?" (What are we able to do?)</p>
        <p><strong>Could</strong>: Used to make polite suggestions or talk about possibilities.</p>
        <p class="example-sentence">Example: "We <em>could</em> try to eat less meat?" (This is a suggestion.)</p>
        <p><strong>Form</strong>: <em>can / could + base verb</em> (no -s/-es for he/she/it)</p>
