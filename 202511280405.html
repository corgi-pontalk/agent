        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, guess what? I'm going on a business trip!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, Alice! That's... exciting? Where are you off to, a fancy resort or a cubicle farm in Ohio?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Ha! Very funny. It's actually to Singapore.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Singapore! Wow, lucky you! Don't forget my souvenir durian. Kidding!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Durian? No way! I'm already stressed about packing. Do I need formal wear or just my pajamas?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Depends on the meetings. But definitely pack some comfy shoes. You'll be walking a lot, or running from angry durian vendors.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You're not helping! This is my first time traveling for work. I'm a bit nervous.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Don't worry too much. A business trip is mostly just work in a different place. But with hotel shampoo!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: True, hotel shampoo is a luxury. But what if I forget something important? My passport, my laptop...</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Make a checklist! And double-check everything. Like, three times. I once forgot my toothbrush. Not fun.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Ugh, I can imagine. So, any actual useful advice, Mr. Globetrotter?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alright, alright. Seriously, try to enjoy the new place a little if you can. And remember to try local food! Just maybe not the durian.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Thanks, Bob. I'll try. And I promise to send you postcards of all the weird food I eat.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Perfect! Have a great trip, Alice!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Thanks! Wish me luck!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>A business trip, often called a work trip or corporate travel, is when an employee travels away from their usual place of work for business purposes. This can be for a variety of reasons, such as attending meetings with clients, participating in conferences, undergoing specialized training, or visiting another company branch. Business trips are a common part of many modern jobs, allowing people to collaborate face-to-face, build relationships, and explore new markets. While they involve travel and staying in hotels, the main focus is always on work. However, many people try to find a little time to explore the new city if their schedule allows!</p>

    <div class="grammar-points">
        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <h3>1. Present Continuous for Future Plans</h3>
        <p>We often use the <strong>present continuous</strong> (subject + <code>am/is/are</code> + verb-<code>ing</code>) to talk about future arrangements or plans that are already decided and fixed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: "I <strong>am going</strong> on a business trip next week." (The trip is already planned.)</li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: "She <strong>is meeting</strong> the client tomorrow afternoon." (The meeting is arranged.)</li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: "They <strong>are flying</strong> to London on Monday." (The flight is booked.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Imperatives (Commands and Suggestions)</h3>
        <p>Imperatives are used to give commands, instructions, or make strong suggestions. We use the base form of the verb.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive Imperatives</strong>: Start with the base form of the verb.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>Make</strong> a checklist!"</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>Try</strong> to enjoy the new place."</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Negative Imperatives</strong>: Use "Don't" + base form of the verb.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>Don't worry</strong> too much!"</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>Don't forget</strong> your passport."</em></p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Question Words (Wh- questions)</h3>
        <p>Words like <code>What</code>, <code>Where</code>, <code>Why</code>, <code>When</code>, <code>Who</code>, and <code>How</code> are used to ask for specific information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Where</strong>: Asks about location.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>Where</strong> are you off to?"</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What</strong>: Asks for information about a thing or action.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>What</strong> if I forget something important?"</em></p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>What</strong>'s up?"</em></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Do/Did/Does</strong> + Subject + Verb: Used for yes/no questions.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>"<strong>Do</strong> I need formal wear?"</em></p>
