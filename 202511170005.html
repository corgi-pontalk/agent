    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, fancy seeing you looking so... serious. What's got your brow furrowed?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Just trying to make sense of this headline: "U.S.–EU Trade Negotiations Hit Snag." My brain feels like it's hitting a snag too.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, *that*. Isn't that just a bunch of fancy words for "we're arguing about how much we like each other's stuff"?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Precisely! But it's more complicated. It's like, imagine I want to sell you my vintage comic books, but you insist I also buy your collection of antique thimbles.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Thimbles, Bob? You've truly lost the plot. But I get it. So, they're haggling over who sells what to whom, and at what price?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Essentially. The U.S. might want fewer tariffs on its agricultural products, while the EU wants protections for its luxury goods or digital services. It's a classic tit-for-tat.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: "Tit-for-tat"? Is that a technical trade term? Sounds like something my siblings do over the last cookie.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Pretty much the same principle, just with billions of dollars and geopolitical implications instead of cookie crumbs.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, if they *don't* agree, what happens? Do we suddenly run out of imported Italian coffee? Because that's a deal-breaker for my mornings.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, not immediately. But it could mean higher prices on certain goods, slower economic growth, or even new trade barriers. Your coffee might get pricier, yes!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: No! This is serious, Bob! My caffeine addiction depends on these negotiations going smoothly. Who knew international trade was so personal?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It affects everything, Alice. From the car you drive to the phone in your hand. Global supply chains, you know.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, they're like a really intense group project where everyone has different ideas, and the grade affects *our* entire economy?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Spot on! And if they can't find common ground, everyone's "grade" suffers. It's all about finding that sweet spot for mutual benefit.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Right, so let's hope they find their "sweet spot" quickly. I can't afford a future without affordable espresso. Good luck, negotiators! Bob, you owe me a coffee if this goes south.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-content"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Deal! But I'm pretty sure my thimble collection is staying put.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The U.S. and the EU maintain one of the world's largest trade and investment relationships. Despite their close ties, trade negotiations frequently encounter complexities. Key areas of contention typically include tariffs on industrial goods, agricultural subsidies, digital services taxes, and regulatory alignment. Both sides aim to reduce trade barriers, promote fair competition, and strengthen their economic partnership, often balancing domestic interests with the broader goal of a robust transatlantic economy. Recent discussions have focused on resolving disputes related to steel and aluminum tariffs, as well as finding common ground on new technologies and climate-related trade policies.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Speculation and Opinion (Could, Might, Would)</h3>
    <p>Modal verbs like 'could', 'might', and 'would' are frequently used to express possibility, probability, or opinion about future or hypothetical situations, rather than certainty. They add a degree of uncertainty or conditionality to a statement.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Could</strong>: Suggests a general possibility or capability.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: Your coffee <strong>could</strong> get pricier. (It's possible.)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Might</strong>: Also suggests possibility, often indicating a slightly lower degree of certainty than 'could'.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: The U.S. <strong>might</strong> want fewer tariffs. (It's a possibility, but not definite.)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Would</strong>: Primarily used in conditional sentences to talk about hypothetical outcomes or situations that depend on a condition.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: If they don't agree, it <strong>would</strong> mean higher prices. (This outcome is conditional on their disagreement.)</em></p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Phrasal Verbs</h3>
    <p>Phrasal verbs combine a verb with an adverb or a preposition (or both) to create a new meaning that is often idiomatic and different from the original verb. They are very common in informal and conversational English.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Make sense of</strong>: To understand something.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: Just trying to <strong>make sense of</strong> this headline.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hit a snag</strong>: To encounter an unexpected problem or difficulty.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: My brain feels like it's <strong>hitting a snag</strong> too.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Run out of</strong>: To use up or finish a supply of something.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: Do we suddenly <strong>run out of</strong> imported Italian coffee?</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Go south</strong>: To decline in quality, value, or condition; to fail or turn out badly.
            <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example: You owe me a coffee if this <strong>goes south</strong>.</em></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
