    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, guess what I just read? Something about mini-suns!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, are you talking about fusion energy again? Did someone finally put a star in a jar?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Well, not *in* a jar, but they're making some serious progress! Like, powering cities with sea water progress!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Ah, the <strong>holy grail of clean energy</strong>. It's always "<strong>just around the corner</strong>," isn't it? For the last 70 years.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: But this time it feels different! I saw a headline about a "<strong>net energy gain</strong>." That sounds like a big deal!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It *is* a big deal! It means they got more energy out than they put in to start the reaction. It's a massive scientific milestone.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, no more worrying about fossil fuels? Or my electricity bill doubling next winter?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: In theory, yes! But we're still talking about <strong>experimental reactors</strong>, not power plants on every street corner. There are still huge engineering challenges.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Challenges like what? Keeping the <strong>plasma</strong> hotter than the sun for longer than a blink?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! And containing it, scaling it up, finding affordable materials that can withstand those extreme conditions... It's not a trivial task.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, my dream of unlimited, cheap energy for my super-cool apartment still needs a few decades?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Optimistically, yes. Maybe 20-30 years until <strong>commercial viability</strong>, if everything goes perfectly.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Pfft. I'll be ancient by then. Can't they just hurry up? I want my electric flying car and guilt-free hot showers *now*.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Patience, Alice, patience. The good news is, the science is proving it's possible. We're on the right track.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Okay, fine. But when they do get it, I'm expecting a personal fusion reactor for my coffee machine. Deal?</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Fusion energy research aims to harness the same process that powers the sun and stars – combining light atomic nuclei to release vast amounts of energy. Unlike nuclear fission (used in current power plants), fusion produces little long-lived radioactive waste and doesn't rely on scarce resources; its primary fuel can be extracted from seawater. For decades, fusion has been an elusive goal, often dubbed the "holy grail" of clean energy.</p>
    <p>Recently, however, significant breakthroughs have occurred. Notably, in December 2022, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the US announced it had achieved a "net energy gain" in an experiment, meaning the fusion reaction produced more energy than the lasers used to initiate it. This was a monumental scientific milestone. Large international projects like ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) in France are also progressing, building a reactor designed to produce significant fusion power. While commercial fusion power plants are still decades away due to immense engineering and material challenges (like containing superheated plasma at millions of degrees Celsius for sustained periods), these advances indicate that the scientific feasibility of fusion power is increasingly being demonstrated.</p>

        <li><strong>Just around the corner</strong>: An idiom meaning something is expected to happen very soon.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Fusion power has often been said to be <strong>just around the corner</strong>, but real progress is happening now.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Powering cities</strong>: Providing electricity for urban areas.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Imagine <strong>powering cities</strong> around the world with abundant, emissions-free fusion energy.</p></li>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Present Perfect Continuous (for ongoing actions leading to the present):</strong></p>
    <p>This tense is used to talk about actions that started in the past and are still continuing, or have just finished and have a result in the present.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structure: Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing (present participle)</li>
        <li>Example from dialogue: "They've <strong>been making</strong> some serious progress!" (The progress started in the past and continues to the present).</li>
        <li>Other examples:
            <ul>
                <li>Scientists <strong>have been working</strong> on fusion technology for decades.</li>
                <li>The team <strong>has been researching</strong> new materials for the reactor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. Modal Verbs for Possibility and Prediction (Could, Might, Will):</strong></p>
    <p>Modal verbs help express different levels of certainty, possibility, or obligation. Here we focus on future predictions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Could / Might</strong>: Express possibility or uncertainty about the future.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Fusion energy <strong>could</strong> revolutionize how we generate power. (It's possible.)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: We <strong>might</strong> see commercial fusion power in 30 years. (It's possible, but not definite.)</p></li>
        <li><strong>Will</strong>: Expresses a strong prediction or certainty about the future.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: It <strong>will</strong> take decades for fusion to reach commercial viability. (Strong prediction based on current understanding.)</p>
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: If successful, fusion power <strong>will</strong> provide clean electricity. (Certain outcome if the condition is met.)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 - Real Conditions):</strong></p>
    <p>Used to talk about a real or very probable situation in the future and its likely result. It connects a condition (if-clause) with a consequence (main clause).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structure: <strong>If + simple present, will + base verb</strong></li>
        <li>Example from dialogue: "...if everything goes perfectly." (Implicitly, "If everything goes perfectly, it will be ready in 20-30 years.")</li>
        <li>Other examples:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If</strong> they can scale it up, fusion <strong>will</strong> become a reality.</li>
                <li><strong>If</strong> the experiment succeeds, it <strong>will prove</strong> the theory.</li>
                <li>We <strong>will have</strong> abundant energy <strong>if</strong> fusion technology develops successfully.</li>
