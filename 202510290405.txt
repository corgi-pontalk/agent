Alice : Oh, Bob, look at this giant fluffy alpaca plushie! It’s adorable! Bob : Alice, that thing is bigger than your head! You can’t be serious. How much is it? Alice : *Checks tag* It says50! Fifty dollars for a stuffed animal? That’s a bit steep, don’t you think? Bob : Steep? That’s highway robbery for something that just sits there looking cute! Time to bargain! Alice : Bargain? Me? I’m terrible at that! What do I even say? Bob : Just try, "Is this your best price?" Start there. Alice : *Clears throat, approaches the vendor* Excuse me, is this your best price for this lovely alpaca? Alice : *Turns to Bob, whispers* He just nodded and said it's lucky! Bob : Okay, now offer something lower. Don't be shy! Try30. Alice : Thirty dollars? That’s a big jump! Okay… *To vendor* How about30? Alice : *Whispers to Bob* He said45! Still too much! Bob : Okay, counter! Try35. And look sad! Alice : *To vendor, with a pout* Could you do35? It's for my... very sad goldfish. He needs cheering up. Alice : *Gasps, whispers to Bob* He went down to40! For the goldfish! Bob : Nice work, Alice! Now, if you *really* want it, take it. Or you can try to walk away. Alice : I really want it! Okay,40 it is! *To vendor* Deal! Bob : Wow, Alice, you’re a natural! Who knew your goldfish had such bargaining power? Alice : He’s a very emotional goldfish, Bob! And now he has a giant alpaca friend!
