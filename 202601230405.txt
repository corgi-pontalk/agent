Alice: Hi Bob, you look a bit… dishevelled. Rough morning?
Bob: Alice! You have no idea. My bus was late, then I missed my train, and I almost rode a unicycle to work!
Alice: A unicycle? Seriously? Did you actually try?
Bob: No, not seriously! But it felt like the only option left. I even thought about buying roller skates and a cape.
Alice: Roller skates and a cape? That's quite a commute! I usually just take the subway. It's fast and cape-free.
Bob: Fast? Mine felt like a snail race in slow motion. Do you ever drive?
Alice: Sometimes, but parking is a nightmare. And gas is so expensive, my wallet cries.
Bob: Tell me about it. I once tried carpooling, but my carpool buddy sang opera at the top of his lungs. Every. Single. Day.
Alice: Opera? Oh no! I guess the subway isn't so bad then, even with questionable smells.
Bob: Exactly! I'm seriously thinking of getting a bicycle. Good for exercise, good for the planet, good for escaping opera.
Alice: That's a great idea! Just watch out for the pigeons. They're very confident cyclists, they don't even use helmets.
Bob: Pigeons? I'll add 'evade avian cyclists' to my list of commute challenges. At least they don't sing opera.
Alice: True! So, bicycle it is then? You might even arrive on time for once!
Bob: One can dream, Alice. One can dream. Maybe I'll get a helmet with a built-in pigeon deterrent.
Alice: Good luck with that, Bob! See you later - hopefully not on a unicycle!
