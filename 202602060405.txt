Alice : Bob, you ate the last cookie! That's a human rights violation, in my book! Bob : Alice, it was _one_ cookie! And it was in _my_ hand. That's called 'possession'! Alice : But I had 'the right to snack'! Everyone has the right to access delicious baked goods! Bob : Is 'snack rights' really a thing? I thought human rights were, like, more serious. Alice : They are! But the principle applies! Like 'the right to food' - cookies count! Bob : Okay, okay, you've got a point about food. But what about my right to peace and quiet? You were playing your music super loud yesterday. Alice : That's 'freedom of expression' through dance music! And you have the right to ask me to turn it down, which you did, and I did! Bob : True. So, it's about balancing rights, then? Alice : Exactly! My right to loud music doesn't mean I can ignore your right to sleep. Bob : So, if I want to use the TV, and you're watching your K-drama for the tenth time... Alice : We negotiate! My right to binge-watch vs. your right to... sports? News? Bob : My right to _anything else_! So, the 'right to choose' what to watch? Alice : Yes! And the 'right to equality' means we both get fair turns. Bob : Wow, you're making 'human rights' sound like our roommate agreement. Alice : In a way, it is! Just on a much, much bigger scale, for _everyone_. Bob : So, no more cookie theft, then? Alice : Definitely a step in the right direction for 'cookie justice'!
