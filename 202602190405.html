    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, guess what I just saw on TV?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice? Was it a cat playing a tiny piano again?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Even better! A documentary about our solar system! Did you know Jupiter is so big, you could fit all the other planets inside it?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Wow! So, it's like the cosmic King-size bed? And Saturn... that's the one with the fancy hula hoop, right?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Haha, rings made of ice and rock! Not a hula hoop, Bob. And the Moon? Definitely not made of cheese, sadly.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> A giant mozzarella ball... dream big, Alice. So, what about stars? Are they just tiny little light bulbs far away?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Our Sun is a star, and it's HUGE! Other stars are also huge, but they're incredibly far away, so they look small.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> So, the Sun is like our personal, gigantic, free heater and light source. Lucky us!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Pretty much! And we live in a galaxy called the Milky Way. Sounds like a chocolate bar, doesn't it?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> It does! I wonder if there are other galaxies called 'Snickers Nebula' or 'Mars Bar Cluster'!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Haha, probably not, Bob. But there are billions of other galaxies out there.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Billions? My brain just did a little supernova trying to imagine that! So much to learn!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> It's fascinating, isn't it? Space is full of wonders!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Absolutely! So, if I train really hard, do you think I can jump to the Moon?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Not quite, Bob! You'd need a spaceship for that. But we can always go stargazing!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Deal! I'll bring the snacks, just in case we find that cheese moon.</p>
