    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob! What's that smell? It's... interesting. And a little smoky!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, hi Alice! Don't worry, it's just me trying to bake cookies. My grandmother's secret recipe!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Cookies? It smells more like a dragon sneezed in the oven. Are you sure you're baking, not burning?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: They're a *special* kind of cookie. Very... crispy. I just took them out!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Peers into the kitchen) Bob, are those supposed to be charcoal briquettes? They are very, very dark.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Well, the recipe said "bake until golden brown." I thought, "More brown, more golden, right?"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: "Golden brown" means light brown, not "black like my coffee without milk"! What did you use?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Flour, eggs, sugar... and then I needed "a pinch of salt." I think I used a *handful*.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: A handful of salt? For cookies? Bob, that's a bold move. No wonder they look like rocks!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: But it said "white powder"! Sugar is white, salt is white... same difference, right?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, no! Sugar is sweet, salt is salty! You need a cooking lesson, my friend!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: But I bought a new mixing bowl! And this cool whisk! They're for cooking!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Equipment is good, but ingredients and instructions are key. Do you have any *real* sugar left?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Yes! And some chocolate chips. I didn't get to use them. The cookies were too... robust.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Okay, let's start over. I'll help. And this time, no "handfuls" of mystery white powder!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Cooking and kitchens are central to our daily lives, whether we're making a quick snack or preparing a fancy meal. Many people enjoy cooking as a hobby, using various kitchen tools like mixing bowls, whisks, and ovens to create delicious dishes. Recipes guide us, telling us what ingredients (like flour, eggs, sugar, salt, and chocolate chips) to use and how to combine them. However, it's easy to make mistakes, especially for beginners â€“ sometimes things get burnt, or the wrong ingredients are used, leading to funny (and sometimes inedible!) results. Learning to cook is a journey that often involves a lot of trial and error, but it's a rewarding skill that brings people together.</p>

        <h3>1. The verb "to be" (Present Simple)</h3>
        <p>The verb "to be" is one of the most common verbs in English. We use it to talk about facts, descriptions, and states of being.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>2. Present Continuous Tense (for actions happening now)</h3>
        <p>We use the Present Continuous tense to talk about actions that are happening at the moment of speaking or around now. The structure is <strong>"to be" (am/is/are) + verb-ing</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples from dialogue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>"it's just me <strong>trying to bake</strong> cookies." (It is trying)</li>
            <li>"Are you sure you're <strong>baking</strong>, not <strong>burning</strong>?" (Are you baking, are you burning)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>More examples:</strong></p>
