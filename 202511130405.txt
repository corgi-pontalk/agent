Alice : Hey Bob, how was your weekend? Did you finally conquer that mountain? Bob : Oh, Alice, you won't believe it! I tried, but the summit felt miles away. My legs are still screaming! Alice : (Laughs) I told you to train! What happened? Did you get lost on the trail again? Bob : Not lost, exactly. More like... "exploring alternative paths." And then I saw a tiny squirrel with a really big acorn and got distracted. Alice : A squirrel? Bob, you went all that way to be captivated by a squirrel? Bob : Hey, it was a very determined squirrel! Anyway, the view from the halfway point was amazing. You could see the whole valley! Alice : That sounds nice. Did you make it to the forest part? I hear it's really peaceful there. Bob : Yes, the forest was beautiful! But then I looked up and saw the cliff face... and realized I probably needed more gear than just my lunchbox. Alice : (Chuckles) No backpack? No proper hiking boots? Bob, you're an adventure waiting to happen... in a very unprepared way. Bob : My old sneakers are fine! Mostly. I did slip once, almost rolled down to the next peak. Good thing I grabbed a sturdy tree branch! Alice : Be careful! So, no summit for you this time, huh? Bob : Not this time. My altitude sickness was really just "tired legs" sickness. But next time, I'm getting proper climbing lessons! And a bigger backpack. Alice : Good plan! Maybe we can go together next time. I know a great mountain range not too far from here. Bob : Really? With fewer determined squirrels, I hope? And maybe a flatter trail? Alice : (Smiles) We'll see, Bob. We'll see. But it will definitely have a breathtaking view!
