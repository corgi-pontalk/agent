Alice: Hey, Bob! You look like you're lost in thought. Everything okay?
Bob: Oh, hey Alice! Yeah, I'm just… contemplating the mysteries of the universe, or maybe what I should have for lunch. Why? You look like you've just discovered a secret map to buried treasure.
Alice: Funnier than that, actually. I've been planning my dream trip to France!
Bob: France! Ooh la la! Paris, the Eiffel Tower, tiny berets... are you going to wear one?
Alice: Probably not a beret, but definitely pastries! I'm picturing myself sitting at a café, sipping coffee, and devouring the flakiest croissant known to mankind.
Bob: Sounds idyllic! Don't forget the Louvre. You absolutely *must* see the Mona Lisa. And maybe try to find a real-life Quasimodo.
Alice: Haha, I'll add Quasimodo hunting to the itinerary! But seriously, I want to explore beyond Paris too. Maybe a small village in Provence, or the lavender fields.
Bob: Provence! You could ride a bicycle with a basket full of baguettes, singing French songs! Just remember, those trips aren't cheap. Are you saving up?
Alice: Tell me about it! I'm on a super strict budget. No more fancy lattes for me, it's black coffee and dreams of the Côte d'Azur. I've been working extra shifts and practically living on instant noodles.
Bob: Hmm, instant noodles... A small price to pay for French bliss! You know, if you wanted to save even more, you could just... print out a picture of the Eiffel Tower and stick it on your wall. Same view, zero airfare!
Alice: (Laughing) Very funny, Bob. But I think the smell of fresh baguettes and ancient history would be hard to replicate with a printout.
Bob: Fair point! But think of the money you'd save! You could buy a lifetime supply of instant noodles and still have change for a plastic beret.
Alice: You're ridiculous! But the thought of it definitely keeps me motivated. It'll be worth every penny, eventually.
Bob: Absolutely! And when you go, promise to send me a postcard of a very confused Quasimodo holding a baguette.
Alice: Deal! Now, back to my spreadsheet of French dreams...
