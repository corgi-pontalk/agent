    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Hi Bob, what are you listening to? Soundsâ€¦ interesting.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oh, hey Alice! It's my new favorite band, 'Screaming Squirrels'! They make avant-garde noise music.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Screaming Squirrels? Bob, are you serious? My ears are crying.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Come on, it's genius! Very experimental. What about you? Still listening to pop?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Pop is great! And yes, I'm trying to learn the ukulele.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> The ukulele? That tiny guitar? Are you planning a Hawaiian vacation?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> No! It's cute and easy to carry. But my fingers hurt. And I sound like a cat stepping on strings.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> (laughs) I can imagine! I tried playing the drums once. My neighbors did not appreciate my rhythm.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> I bet! Did you have a drum set?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Just a few pots and pans, a wooden spoon... and a very patient dog.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> That explains the "noise" part. So, what's your favorite instrument to <em>listen</em> to?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Definitely the electric guitar. It's so cool. Like a rock star!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> I like the piano. It sounds beautiful and elegant.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> We have very different tastes, Alice. From screaming squirrels to elegant pianos!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> That's why we're friends, Bob! We balance each other out. And maybe you can teach me to appreciate screaming squirrels one day.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> (chuckles) Maybe. But first, let's get you sounding less like a distressed feline on your ukulele!</p>
