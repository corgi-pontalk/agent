Alice: Bob, is that really you? Welcome back! I almost didn't recognize you without a giant camera around your neck.
Bob: Haha, Alice! Good to see you too. The camera is safely packed. And guess what? I brought you something!
Alice: Oh, a souvenir for _me_? You're too kind! Is it something edible? I'm starving.
Bob: Better than edible! It's... a mini replica of the leaning tower of Pisa, but it's _also_ a bottle opener!
Alice: Wow, Bob! A leaning tower _and_ a bottle opener? My kitchen needs this absurdity. Thanks!
Bob: And for myself, I got this amazing hat! It's shaped like a giant pretzel. Very traditional, I assure you.
Alice: A pretzel hat? Bob, are you planning to open a German bakery or just confuse pigeons?
Bob: It's stylish! And practical. Keeps the sun off. And it makes people smile. See? _(Puts it on.)_
Alice: Okay, you _do_ look like a giant snack. But I admit, it made _me_ smile. What other treasures did you find?
Bob: Oh, just this lovely snow globe. It has tiny, glittery spaghetti inside. For Rome!
Alice: Spaghetti snow globe? That's... surprisingly creative. Do you shake it and wish for dinner?
Bob: Exactly! And it never goes bad. It's the perfect souvenir. No calories, either!
Alice: You really have a knack for finding the most unique souvenirs. My fridge is still recovering from your last magnet collection.
Bob: Exactly! Souvenirs should tell a story, even if the story is 'Bob bought a pretzel hat'.
Alice: Well, your stories are always entertaining. Thanks again for the leaning tower bottle opener, Bob!
Bob: Anytime, Alice! Next trip, I'll find you a croissant-shaped umbrella!
