    <h2>Dialogue</h2>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, did you hear about the Tokyo Marathon 2025?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice, I did! My social media is already buzzing with "I'm training for it!" posts. Like, really?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Tell me about it. I saw a guy post about his 'long run' being 5k. I nearly choked on my coffee.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Hey, 5k is a start! For *some* people. Me, I'm just looking forward to the epic costumes.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Ah, the costume runners! They're definitely a highlight. Remember the guy dressed as a giant sushi roll?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> How could I forget? He was practically rolling himself across the finish line. I bet his soy sauce dipping station was a hit.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> You'd think they'd trip. But no, they power through. What are you actually looking forward to, Bob? The elite runners breaking records?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Honestly? The drama. Will someone bonk spectacularly? Will there be a surprise underdog winner? It's like a live-action sports soap opera.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> You're terrible! But true, the stories are always gripping. I'm excited to see if they introduce any new tech or course changes.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oh, definitely. Imagine if they had a giant conveyor belt for the last 5k. Instant personal bests for everyone!</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> That defeats the purpose, you couch potato! But a massage station at the 30k mark? Now *that* I could get behind.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Genius! Or maybe a ramen stand at the halfway point. Fueling up in style.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> You're just thinking with your stomach, as usual. I'm more curious about the atmosphere. The crowds are always incredible.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> That's it, Alice! The energy from the spectators is infectious. Even if you're just watching from your sofa, you feel it.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly. It's truly one of the biggest spectacles in Tokyo. Maybe we should go watch it live this time?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Only if you promise to hold my ramen for me while I cheer. My arms get tired.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Deal! But you're buying the ramen.</p>
