    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, guess what! I just had <strong>an</strong> amazing idea!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! What's up? You look like you just saw <strong>a</strong> giant, talking squirrel!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: No, silly! Even better! I'm going to bake <strong>the</strong> biggest cookie in <strong>the</strong> world!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Bob</strong>: <strong>A</strong> giant cookie? You mean, like, <strong>a</strong> cookie <strong>the</strong> size of <strong>a</strong> car tire?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! I need <strong>a</strong> lot of chocolate chips and <strong>a</strong> really, really big oven.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Bob</strong>: Do you have <strong>the</strong> special recipe from your grandma? You know, <strong>the</strong> one with <strong>the</strong> secret ingredient?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, <strong>the</strong> secret ingredient! I almost forgot! It's just <strong>a</strong> pinch of cinnamon, but it makes <strong>a</strong> big difference. It's <strong>an</strong> old family secret!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Bob</strong>: Can I help? I can be <strong>a</strong> taste tester. Or maybe <strong>a</strong> chief flour sifter!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: You? <strong>A</strong> chief flour sifter? Last time you tried to bake, you mistook flour for sugar and made <strong>a</strong> very salty cake.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Bob</strong>: Hey, that was <strong>an</strong> accident! I was tired. I promise I'll be <strong>a</strong> good helper this time. I even brought <strong>a</strong> new apron!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: Hmm, okay. We'll need <strong>an</strong> egg and <strong>a</strong> cup of milk first. And <strong>the</strong> measuring spoons.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Bob</strong>: Got it! Where's <strong>the</strong> milk? Oh, wait, is it <strong>the</strong> milk in <strong>the</strong> red carton or <strong>the</strong> blue carton?</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: <strong>The</strong> red one, Bob! <strong>The</strong> one that says "whole milk." Don't grab <strong>a</strong> random carton!</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Bob</strong>: Okay, got it! This is going to be <strong>a</strong> legendary cookie. I'll get <strong>the</strong> egg.</p>
    <p class="dialogue-exchange"><strong>Alice</strong>: Let's hope so! Or it will be <strong>a</strong> very expensive, very salty mistake. Wish us luck!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Welcome, English learners! Today, we're talking about tiny but important words called "articles": <strong>a</strong>, <strong>an</strong>, and <strong>the</strong>. Many languages don't have these, so they can feel a bit strange at first, but don't worry! They help us tell people if we're talking about just "any" thing or "a very specific" thing. Think of them like little signposts that guide your listener to understand exactly what you mean. Mastering them will make your English sound much more natural and clear!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points: Articles (a, an, the)</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. "A" and "An" (Indefinite Articles)</h3>
        <p>Use "a" or "an" when you talk about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Something general, not specific:</strong> You're talking about <em>any</em> one of something.
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> I want <strong>a</strong> cookie. (Any cookie will do!)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Something you mention for the first time:</strong>
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> I saw <strong>a</strong> dog. (First time mentioning the dog)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Singular, countable nouns:</strong> Things you can count (one cookie, two cookies).
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> <strong>a</strong> book, <strong>an</strong> apple</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>When to use "a" vs. "an":</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"A"</strong> is used before words that start with a <strong>consonant sound</strong>.
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Examples:</em> <strong>a</strong> car, <strong>a</strong> banana, <strong>a</strong> university (starts with a 'y' sound), <strong>a</strong> happy child</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>"An"</strong> is used before words that start with a <strong>vowel sound</strong> (a, e, i, o, u).
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Examples:</em> <strong>an</strong> apple, <strong>an</strong> elephant, <strong>an</strong> idea, <strong>an</strong> orange, <strong>an</strong> umbrella, <strong>an</strong> hour (the 'h' is silent, starts with 'ow' sound)</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Remember: It's about the SOUND, not just the letter!</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. "The" (Definite Article)</h3>
        <p>Use "the" when you talk about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Something specific or already known:</strong> Both you and the listener know exactly which thing you're talking about.
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> Can you pass me <strong>the</strong> book? (There's a specific book we both know about.)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Something mentioned before:</strong> After you introduce something with "a" or "an", you use "the" to refer to it again.
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> I saw <strong>a</strong> cat. <strong>The</strong> cat was black. (Now it's specific!)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Unique things:</strong> When there's only one of something.
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Examples:</em> <strong>the</strong> sun, <strong>the</strong> moon, <strong>the</strong> Eiffel Tower</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Superlatives:</strong> (the biggest, the best, the most interesting)
                <span class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> This is <strong>the</strong> best cookie!</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>"The" can be used with singular, plural, countable, and uncountable nouns.</strong></p>
        <span class="example-sentence"><em>Examples:</em> <strong>the</strong> apples, <strong>the</strong> milk, <strong>the</strong> chairs</span>
