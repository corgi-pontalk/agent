Alice: Hey Bob, how was your first day at the new art class?
Bob: Oh, hey Alice! It was interesting. Our teacher, Mr. Sketch, is... well, he's a bit serious.
Alice: Serious? Oh no! Is he like, "no smiling ever" serious?
Bob: Not _that_ serious, but he doesn't laugh much. He's very focused on drawing straight lines.
Alice: Haha! Sounds like fun. What about the other students? Any funny people?
Bob: Hmm, there's one guy, Leo. He told a joke during the break. He's definitely funny.
Alice: A comedian in an art class! That's good. What about kind people?
Bob: Yes, there's Sarah. She helped me find my charcoal pencils when I dropped them. She's very kind.
Alice: Aww, that's nice of her. So, you have a serious teacher, a funny classmate, and a kind classmate.
Bob: Exactly! It's a good mix. What about your new book club, Alice? Any interesting personalities there?
Alice: Oh, it's great! Our leader, Maria, is super kind. She always makes sure everyone gets to speak.
Bob: That's lovely. And is anyone funny?
Alice: Yes, David! He makes jokes about the books. He's really funny.
Bob: So, no serious people in your book club?
Alice: Well, maybe a little bit. There's one lady, Mrs. Peterson, who takes every plot twist _very_ seriously. But in a good way!
Bob: Sounds like fun. So, Alice, would you say _I_ am serious, funny, or kind?
Alice: Bob, you're definitely funny! And kind, sometimes. Serious? Only when you're thinking about pizza.
