Alice: Bob, I have a brilliant idea!
Bob: Oh, Alice? About what? Your innovative way to avoid doing dishes again?
Alice: Even better! An invention to make toast without burning it, ever!
Bob: Hmm, that’s a real challenge. We need to brainstorm some creative solutions.
Alice: I’m thinking a small robot arm... or maybe a smart device that senses heat.
Bob: A robot arm just for toast? That sounds like a bit much, Alice.
Alice: But think of the potential! No more burnt edges, perfect crispiness! It's a technological breakthrough for breakfast!
Bob: Okay, you're really passionate about this. What's the next step? Developing a prototype?
Alice: First, we define the problem clearly: burnt toast, crumbs everywhere, butter that's too cold.
Bob: Right. And then, we iterate? Make it better and better?
Alice: Precisely! We'll be the pioneers of perfect toast. It’s a game- changer!
Bob: This sounds like a lot of work for a slice of bread, Alice. But I’m in! Let’s get creative!
Alice: Excellent! Our innovation journey begins now! To the kitchen!
Bob: Wait, do we need a patent for this revolutionary toast idea?
Alice: Maybe later, Bob. First, let’s just make one good piece of toast. One small step for man, one giant leap for breakfast!
