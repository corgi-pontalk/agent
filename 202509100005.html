    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Bob, you won't believe what I just read! It's about the upcoming 'Global Games' and...</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Alice, let me guess, another country is throwing a diplomatic tantrum?</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> "Tantrum" is one way to put it! Apparently, several nations are <strong>diplomatically boycotting</strong> the opening ceremony.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Ah, the classic "we'll send our athletes, but not our politicians" move. Like inviting someone to a party but telling them their annoying cousin can't come.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Exactly! But the athletes still get to compete, so it's not a full boycott like, say, an actual trade embargo.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> It's more of a <strong>symbolic gesture</strong>, isn't it? A way to <strong>voice disapproval</strong> without completely pulling out.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Precisely. It's like saying, "We disapprove of your policies, but we still love sports!"</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> I wonder if it actually <strong>makes a difference</strong> though. Does the host country really feel the sting?</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Well, it definitely <strong>draws attention to</strong> the issues, doesn't it? The media is all over it.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> True. And it puts pressure on the host country to address whatever human rights concerns or political issues are being highlighted.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Like a very public, very polite rebuke. Imagine if my mom boycotted my graduation because she didn't like my cap!</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> (Laughs) That would be a <strong>bold statement</strong>, Alice. But at least she'd still buy you dinner, right?</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> Probably, but with a <strong>subtle air of disapproval</strong>. I guess that's what diplomatic boycotts are â€“ a subtle air of disapproval on a global scale.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> You've perfectly encapsulated it. It's a high-stakes, well-dressed protest.</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice:</span> So, are you going to watch the opening ceremony, even with all this political drama?</div>
    <div class="dialogue-line"><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob:</span> Oh absolutely. I'm there for the synchronized swimming and the giant inflatable mascots, regardless of who's in the VIP box.</div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Diplomatic boycotts involve governments choosing not to send their high-ranking officials or political representatives to major international events, such as the Olympic Games or other global gatherings. This action serves as a symbolic protest or a "soft power" tool to express disapproval of the host country's policies, human rights record, or other geopolitical actions, without resorting to a full boycott that would prevent athletes or cultural groups from participating. These boycotts aim to draw international attention to specific issues and exert moral or political pressure on the host nation, often without directly impacting the event's sporting or cultural aspects.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diplomatic boycott</strong>: An official refusal by a government to send political representatives to an event, while still allowing athletes or cultural participants.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Several nations announced a <strong>diplomatic boycott</strong> of the upcoming Winter Games.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Symbolic gesture</strong>: An action that communicates a particular message or meaning, rather than having a direct practical effect.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: The protest was largely a <strong>symbolic gesture</strong> to raise awareness.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Voice disapproval</strong>: To express disagreement or negative judgment about something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Activists gathered to <strong>voice disapproval</strong> of the new environmental policy.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Draw attention to (something)</strong>: To cause people to notice or think about something.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: The campaign aims to <strong>draw attention to</strong> the plight of endangered species.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Make a difference</strong>: To have a significant effect on a person or situation.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Every small effort can <strong>make a difference</strong> in the long run.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Bold statement</strong>: A strong, impactful declaration or action.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Wearing that outfit was certainly a <strong>bold statement</strong>.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Subtle air of disapproval</strong>: A quiet, understated way of showing that one does not approve.
            <p class="example-sentence">Example: Her silence carried a <strong>subtle air of disapproval</strong>.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Present Continuous for Future Arrangements/Plans</span>
            <p>We often use the present continuous tense (<code>be + verb-ing</code>) to talk about definite plans or arrangements in the near future, especially when a time or date is mentioned or clearly implied. It implies that the event is already decided and organized.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "another country <strong>is throwing</strong> a diplomatic tantrum?" (Referring to a potential future action)</li>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "several nations <strong>are diplomatically boycotting</strong> the opening ceremony." (Planned action)</li>
                <li><em>Further Example:</em> "I <strong>am meeting</strong> my friend for coffee tomorrow." (The meeting is arranged.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Phrasal Verbs: "pull out"</span>
            <p>Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with prepositions or adverbs, often changing the meaning of the original verb. <code>"Pull out"</code> is one such verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "without completely <strong>pulling out</strong>."</li>
                <li><em>Explanation:</em> In this context, <strong>"pull out"</strong> means to withdraw from an agreement, competition, or activity. It can also mean to extract something or to leave a place.</li>
                <li><em>Further Example:</em> "The company decided to <strong>pull out</strong> of the deal at the last minute."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="grammar-point">Expressions of Opinion/Wondering: "I wonder if..."</span>
            <p>This phrase is used when you are thinking about something and want to express curiosity, doubt, or a question, often to yourself or indirectly to others. It's a polite way to introduce a thought or a speculative question.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong>I wonder if</strong> it actually makes a difference though."</li>
                <li><em>Explanation:</em> Bob is expressing his curiosity or doubt about the effectiveness of the diplomatic boycott.</li>
                <li><em>Further Example:</em> "<strong>I wonder if</strong> it will rain later today."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
