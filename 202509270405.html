            <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Modal Verbs for Polite Requests</b>: When ordering food, we often use special words called "modal verbs" to sound polite.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>"Could I have...?"</b>: This is a very common and polite way to ask for something.
                            <br><i>Example: Could I have a soda?</i></li>
                        <li><b>"I'd like..."</b>: This is a short form of "I would like..." and it's a polite way to say what you want.
                            <br><i>Example: I'd like the pasta, please.</i></li>
                        <li><b>"May I have...?"</b>: This is also very polite, a bit more formal than "could I have?".
                            <br><i>Example: May I have the bill, please?</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>The Power of "Please" and "Thank You"</b>: These two words are like magic! Always add "please" when you ask for something and "thank you" after you receive it. They make your requests sound much friendlier.
                    <br><i>Example: Can I have some water, please? / Here is your water. Thank you!</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>"Excuse me"</b>: Use "Excuse me" to get someone's attention politely, especially a waiter or waitress, before you make your order or ask a question.
                    <br><i>Example: Excuse me, I'm ready to order.</i>
                </li>
            </ul>
