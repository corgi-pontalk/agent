Alice : Bob, did you see the French Open results? What in the world just happened? Bob : Alice, it was... wild. Utterly, inexplicably wild. Alice : "Wild" is an understatement! Did you see who won the men's singles? Bob : You mean _Gerald from accounting_? I nearly choked on my croissant when I saw that name pop up! Alice : Exactly! And the women's final? A wildcard ranked 300th, who mostly plays in local park tournaments! Bob : I know! My tennis bracket is in tatters. I had all the usual suspects making it to the finals, Nadal, Djokovic... you know, the legends! Alice : Mine too! I swear the universe just decided to prank us tennis fans this year. It felt like watching a parallel universe Grand Slam. Bob : It really did. What about Wimbledon? I heard rumors of something even stranger. Alice : Wimbledon was even crazier! A doubles team of a former pop star and a retired astronaut won. They apparently perfected zero-gravity serves. Bob : No way, Alice! You're pulling my leg! Alice : I am not, Bob! The commentators kept calling them 'The Celestial Smashers'. Federer himself announced his _third_ comeback just to try and figure out their technique. Bob : Zero-gravity serves... I can't even process that. And the US Open? Alice : The US Open had a cat as a ball kid that kept interfering with play. It even batted a ball back over the net once! Bob : Oh, I did see that clip! It was adorable but utterly chaotic. The umpire actually gave it a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct! Alice : These 2025 Grand Slams are definitely going down in history for all the wrong, yet incredibly entertaining, reasons. Bob : Definitely. My therapist says I need to accept the 'new normal' of tennis. I think I need a new therapist, or maybe just a long nap.
