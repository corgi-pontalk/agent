Alice : Ugh, Bob! This selfie is impossible! Bob : What's wrong, Alice? You look like you're fighting a small animal. Alice : I'm trying to get a good profile picture for my social media. It needs to be 'aesthetic'! Bob : Aesthetic? Just smile! Or use a filter. There's one that makes you look like a cat. Alice : No, Bob! Not a cat filter! I want to look cool and natural, but also slightly mysterious. And the lighting is all wrong. Bob : Ah, the classic 'effortless but took three hours' look. Have you tried standing on one leg? Alice : Don't be silly! Maybe I need a 'golden hour' shot. But it's noon. Bob : Right. You need a 'magic hour' filter then. Or just post a picture of your food. Everyone loves food pics. Alice : I already posted my avocado toast this morning. It only got two likes. Bob : Two likes? Maybe your toast wasn't 'influencer-level' enough. Did you add a fancy hashtag? Alice : I added #brunchlife. Isn't that enough? Bob : You need more! Try #foodie #yummy #toasttuesday... even if it's Wednesday. Hashtag everything! Alice : This is exhausting. Maybe I should just post a funny meme instead. They always get lots of shares. Bob : Good idea! Or a picture of your cat. Cats always win the internet. Alice : I don't have a cat, Bob. Fine, I'll just use a 'no filter' filter and hope for the best. Wish me luck! Bob : Good luck, Alice! May your likes be plentiful!
