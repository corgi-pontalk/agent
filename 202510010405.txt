Alice: Bob, are you sure this is the right hotel? It looks a bit... small.
Bob: Alice, of course it is! 'The Cozy Corner Inn.' See? It says so right here on my phone. Cozy means nice, right?
Alice: Well, sometimes 'cozy' means 'fits one person and a teacup.' Let's go in.
Bob: (Bumps into the doorframe) Oops! My bad. Hello, front desk! Receptionist: Welcome to The Cozy Corner Inn! How can I help you?
Bob: Hi! We have a reservation under 'Bob Wobbly.' For two nights. Receptionist: Ah, Mr. Wobbly! Yes, a single room with a... 'compact' bed.
Alice: (Raises an eyebrow at Bob) A single room? Bob, we're two people!
Bob: Oh! Did I click 'single' by mistake? I thought 'single' meant 'super cool'!
Alice: No, Bob. 'Single' means one. Like, one banana. Not two people and two suitcases.
Bob: Receptionist, do you have any other rooms? Maybe with a 'double' bed? Or a 'super cool' bed for two? Receptionist: Let me check... We have one double room left, but it's on the 10th floor. And the elevator is... charmingly old.
Bob: 10th floor? Phew! That's high. But a double bed! Perfect! What about the bathroom? Is there a shower?
Alice: Bob, most hotels have showers. Just confirm the room number, please. Receptionist: Room 1001. Here's your key card. Enjoy your stay!
Bob: Thanks! Come on, Alice! To adventure! Hope the 'charming' elevator doesn't get stuck!
Alice: (Sighs, but smiles) Let's just get to the room, Bob.
