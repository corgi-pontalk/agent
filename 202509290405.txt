Alice: Oh, Bob! Is this the right bus stop for the park? I'm so lost!
Bob: Alice! Hey! Yes, this is it. But which bus are you waiting for?
Alice: Uh... the one that goes to the park? Number... P2, I think?
Bob: P2? Are you sure? The park usually takes the Number 7 bus.
Alice: Oh no! My map said P2! Maybe I read it upside down again.
Bob: (Laughing) Happens to the best of us! Look, here comes a bus. Is that it?
Alice: (Squinting) It says... "Sorry, Not in Service." Oh.
Bob: Nope, that's not it. We need to look for a big number 7 on the front.
Alice: So, when the bus comes, do I just wave? Or stand really still?
Bob: You just stand near the stop. When the Number 7 comes, make eye contact with the driver. Not too intense, though!
Alice: Eye contact... Okay. And then I get on? Do I need a ticket?
Bob: Yes, you can pay with cash or a card. Do you have exact change for cash?
Alice: Exact change? I have a giant twenty-dollar bill. Uh oh.
Bob: (Sighs dramatically) Alice, you're a bus-taking adventure! Don't worry, they usually have card machines.
Alice: Phew! Okay, look! Is that it? A big red bus, with a 7!
Bob: Yes! That's it! Quick, let's get ready!
Alice: Wait, do we get off at the next stop, or the one after? I forgot!
Bob: (Shaking his head, smiling) We'll figure it out, Alice. Just follow me!
Alice: Okay, Bob! My bus guru!
