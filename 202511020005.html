    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, you won't believe what I just saw!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> What is it, Alice? Did you finally spot a unicorn at the charging station?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Even better! I saw three electric vehicles lined up at a <em>single</em> charging point, waiting. It's like they're multiplying!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> See? I told you EVs are taking off. Soon, our gas-guzzling cars will be museum pieces.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> "Gas-guzzling"? Mine still gets me to work without needing a coffee break every 100 miles!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> That's just range anxiety talking, my friend. They've improved batteries so much! My cousin just got a new EV, and he says he can drive from here to the next city and back on one charge.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Impressive. But what about the upfront cost? Those things aren't exactly budget-friendly. My wallet has its own range anxiety.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> True, the initial price tag can be a bit shocking. But with government subsidies and lower running costs, it supposedly balances out. Plus, think of the planet! So eco-friendly.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Oh, I'm all for eco-friendly. I just don't want to be stranded in the middle of nowhere looking for a charger that isn't already occupied by a family of three patiently watching Netflix.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well, the charging infrastructure is growing too. They're popping up everywhere, even at supermarkets. It's a game changer!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> I guess I'm just wary of change. One minute it's horse-drawn carriages, the next it's cars that practically drive themselves.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Exactly! And soon, flying cars! Imagine the traffic jams then. "Excuse me, your flying car just landed on my flying car."</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Haha, let's not get ahead of ourselves. For now, I'll stick to my reliable (and slightly dusty) sedan. But I admit, the future of EVs looks quite bright.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It does! Maybe one day you'll join the silent revolution, Alice. No more roaring engines, just the gentle hum of progress.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> And the even gentler hum of my wallet crying when I look at the price tag. But hey, a girl can dream of quiet, emissions-free commutes!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>
        The global electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing unprecedented growth, transforming the automotive industry and contributing significantly to efforts against climate change. Driven by increasing environmental awareness, stringent emission regulations, and advancements in battery technology, EV sales have surged in recent years. Governments worldwide are playing a crucial role through various incentives, such as purchase subsidies, tax breaks, and investment in charging infrastructure, making EVs more accessible and attractive to consumers. While challenges like the initial upfront cost, range anxiety, and the availability of charging stations persist, continuous innovation is addressing these concerns. The market is witnessing a diversification of EV models, from compact city cars to electric trucks and SUVs, catering to a wider consumer base. This rapid expansion indicates a strong shift towards an electrified future, with many experts predicting EVs will dominate new car sales within the next decade.

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Continuous for Trends and Developments</h3>
    <p>
        We use the present continuous tense (am/is/are + verb-ing) to talk about actions happening now, but also to describe ongoing trends, changes, or developments that are happening around the present time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I told you EVs <strong>are taking off</strong>." (Describes a trend)</li>
        <li><em>Another example:</em> "The charging infrastructure <strong>is growing</strong> too." (Describes a development)</li>
        <li><em>Structure:</em> Subject + am/is/are + verb-ing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Modal Verbs for Possibility and Prediction (will / may / might)</h3>
    <p>
        Modal verbs are used to express possibility, certainty, permission, and more. Here, we focus on their use for predictions and possibilities.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Will</strong>: Used for predictions or statements of future fact, often with a higher degree of certainty.
            <p class="example"><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Soon, our gas-guzzling cars <strong>will be</strong> museum pieces." (Bob's confident prediction)</p></li>
        <li><strong>May / Might</strong>: Used for possibilities or less certain predictions in the future. They suggest something is possible but not guaranteed.
            <p class="example"><em>Example:</em> "Maybe one day you'll join the silent revolution." (Possibility)</p>
            <p class="example"><em>Example:</em> "EVs <strong>may become</strong> even more affordable next year." (Less certain prediction)</p></li>
        <li><em>Structure:</em> Subject + modal verb + base form of the verb.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives</h3>
    <p>
        These are used to compare two or more things.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparative adjectives</strong> compare two items (e.g., <code>bigger</code>, <code>more expensive</code>).
            <p class="example"><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Even <strong>better</strong>!" (Comparing to something else)</p>
            <p class="example"><em>Example:</em> "Electric cars are often <strong>more expensive</strong> than petrol cars initially."</p></li>
        <li><strong>Superlative adjectives</strong> compare three or more items and show which is at the extreme (e.g., <code>biggest</code>, <code>the most expensive</code>).
            <p class="example"><em>Example:</em> "This is <strong>the fastest</strong> electric car on the market."</p></li>
        <li><em>General Rules:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>One-syllable adjectives: add -er (comparative), -est (superlative). (e.g., <code>fast</code>, <code>faster</code>, <code>fastest</code>)</li>
                <li>Two-syllable adjectives ending in -y: change y to i, then add -er/-est. (e.g., <code>easy</code>, <code>easier</code>, <code>easiest</code>)</li>
                <li>Most other two-syllable adjectives and all three+ syllable adjectives: use <code>more</code>/<code>less</code> (comparative), <code>most</code>/<code>least</code> (superlative). (e.g., <code>important</code>, <code>more important</code>, <code>most important</code>)</li>
                <li>Irregular adjectives: <code>good/better/best</code>, <code>bad/worse/worst</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
