Alice : Oh, Bob, I'm so hungry my stomach thinks it's an echo chamber! What are we going to do? Bob : Alice, you look like you're about to eat the wallpaper! Don't worry, I have a brilliant idea! Alice : Please tell me it involves food and zero effort. Bob : Exactly! Room service! We just call, they bring food, magic! Alice : Magic? Or just really good customer service. Do you have the menu? Bob : Uh... I think it's... somewhere. Ah, found it! Under the lamp, next to the remote! Alice : Great. What looks good? I'm craving something cheesy. Bob : Hmm, they have a 'Giant Nacho Volcano'. Or a 'Sleepy Bear Pizza'. Alice : A 'Sleepy Bear Pizza'? What even is that? Let's stick to something safe, like a club sandwich. Bob : But the nachos sound so adventurous! Okay, okay. So, how do we call them? Alice : Usually, there's a button on the phone for 'Room Service' or 'Guest Services'. Bob : (Picks up phone) Okay, found it! Ringing... Hello? Yes, we'd like to order some food. Alice : (Whispering) Be polite, Bob! And tell them your room number! Bob : Oh, right! Room 302. And could we get one club sandwich and... one Giant Nacho Volcano, please? Alice : (Facepalm) Bob! Bob : What? It's for sharing! And maybe two chocolate milkshakes!
