Alice : Hey Bob! What's that smell? It's... interesting. And a little smoky! Bob : Oh, hi Alice! Don't worry, it's just me trying to bake cookies. My grandmother's secret recipe! Alice : Cookies? It smells more like a dragon sneezed in the oven. Are you sure you're baking, not burning? Bob : They're a *special* kind of cookie. Very... crispy. I just took them out! Alice : (Peers into the kitchen) Bob, are those supposed to be charcoal briquettes? They are very, very dark. Bob : Well, the recipe said "bake until golden brown." I thought, "More brown, more golden, right?" Alice : "Golden brown" means light brown, not "black like my coffee without milk"! What did you use? Bob : Flour, eggs, sugar... and then I needed "a pinch of salt." I think I used a *handful*. Alice : A handful of salt? For cookies? Bob, that's a bold move. No wonder they look like rocks! Bob : But it said "white powder"! Sugar is white, salt is white... same difference, right? Alice : Bob, no! Sugar is sweet, salt is salty! You need a cooking lesson, my friend! Bob : But I bought a new mixing bowl! And this cool whisk! They're for cooking! Alice : Equipment is good, but ingredients and instructions are key. Do you have any *real* sugar left? Bob : Yes! And some chocolate chips. I didn't get to use them. The cookies were too... robust. Alice : Okay, let's start over. I'll help. And this time, no "handfuls" of mystery white powder!
