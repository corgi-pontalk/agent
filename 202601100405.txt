Alice : Bob, I'm so bored! What are we doing this weekend? I need a leader to tell me! Bob : Alice! You're calling me a leader? I just know how to make good decisions, that's all. Alice : Well, that's what leaders do! They decide things. And usually, they have a plan, right? Bob : Okay, okay, you got me. My plan is: a grand expedition to the park! Alice : Hmm, a *grand expedition*. Very leader-like! But how will we get there? Bob : I will guide us! Think of me as your personal, slightly lost, GPS. Alice : And who will manage the snacks? A good leader delegates tasks, you know. Bob : Ah, an excellent point! You, Alice, are responsible for the snacks. It's your responsibility to keep the team fueled! Alice : So, you're trying to motivate me with chips? Smart move, *Boss*. Bob : Exactly! A true leader inspires their team to achieve greatness... or at least find the best chips. Alice : Alright, so what's our ultimate goal for this "expedition"? Besides snacks, of course. Bob : Our goal is simple: maximum fun, minimum stress, and maybe a high- five from a squirrel. That's a noble aim! Alice : What if we encounter another "team" at the park? Like, a group of frisbee champions? Bob : Then I will lead our team with courage and... well, maybe we'll just cheer them on. A leader knows when to support! Alice : You're really getting into this role, aren't you, Captain Bob? Bob : Someone has to! Now, follow your leader! To the park and beyond! Alice : Okay, *Admiral*. But I still get to choose the ice cream flavor. My first executive decision!
