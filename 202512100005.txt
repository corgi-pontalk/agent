Alice : Bob, did you hear about the latest doping scandal? Apparently, a marathon runner credited his sudden burst of speed to a new 'super-caffeine' smoothie. Bob : Alice! I saw that! I'm pretty sure my 'super-caffeine' smoothie just makes me want a nap. Alice : Exactly! He probably just had an espresso IV drip. It's getting ridiculous. Bob : It's like a real-life cartoon sometimes. Remember that cyclist who swore his improved performance was due to a 'lucky charm' in his water bottle? Turned out the charm was a microscopic vial of EPO. Alice : Oh, the 'magic pebble' incident! My personal favourite was the swimmer who claimed the chlorine in the pool gave him superhuman lung capacity. Sure, and I can fly if I flap my arms hard enough. Bob : I wonder what excuse they'll come up with next. 'My sweat glands accidentally produced pure testosterone'? Or 'I just had a really good night's sleep... for three years'? Alice : Don't give them ideas, Bob! It's like they're trying to win an Olympic medal for the most creative denial. Bob : Maybe they should have a separate competition: 'Most Unbelievable Doping Excuse.' That would be entertaining. Alice : I'd watch that! Gold medal for the guy who blamed his positive test on second-hand smoke from a unicorn. Bob : Or the athlete who said his muscles spontaneously grew because he listened to too much motivational pop music. Alice : It's a serious issue, though, isn't it? It just undermines the whole spirit of fair play. Bob : Absolutely. When you see someone achieve something incredible, you want to believe it's pure talent and hard work, not pharmaceuticals. Alice : Right. It makes you question every record, every medal. It's such a shame for the clean athletes. Bob : Hopefully, with better testing and harsher penalties, we'll see fewer of these headlines. Alice : Fingers crossed, Bob. Maybe one day 'natural talent' won't be a scandalous excuse.
