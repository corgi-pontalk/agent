    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p>Alice: "Hey Bob, have you noticed how Japanese anime has completely taken over the world lately? My grandma even asked me about 'that show with the cute spy family!'"</p>
        <p>Bob: "Alice, absolutely! It's like you can't scroll through social media without seeing someone cosplaying a <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> character or debating whether Denji is a good boy. Who knew chainsaws could be so adorable?"</p>
        <p>Alice: "Right? It's gone way beyond just us 'otakus.' My coworker, who only watches historical documentaries, is now quoting <em>Attack on Titan</em> theories. I think he secretly wants to be a Survey Corps member."</p>
        <p>Bob: "I wouldn't be surprised! The animation quality these days is just *chef's kiss*. And the storytelling? They're tackling such diverse themes, not just giant robots and magical girls anymore."</p>
        <p>Alice: "True, though I still have a soft spot for giant robots. But seriously, the global reach is insane. Netflix, Crunchyroll – they're pumping out new seasons faster than I can keep up."</p>
        <p>Bob: "It's a double-edged sword, isn't it? On one hand, access is amazing. On the other, my watch list has become a monstrous beast I can never conquer."</p>
        <p>Alice: "Tell me about it! And the merchandise! I saw someone with a <em>Spy x Family</em> plushie for their cat. For their cat, Bob!"</p>
        <p>Bob: "Well, Anya would approve. Speaking of which, have you seen the fan art? The creativity in the community is just mind-blowing."</p>
        <p>Alice: "Totally. It feels like this wave is different from the Dragon Ball Z/Sailor Moon era. It's more mainstream, less niche, and everyone's in on the joke."</p>
        <p>Bob: "Definitely. It’s no longer just a 'kids' thing or a 'nerd' thing. My gym buddy, who looks like he eats barbells for breakfast, is openly weeping over <em>Demon Slayer</em> plot twists."</p>
        <p>Alice: "That's beautiful, Bob. I think it's the emotional depth. These stories just hit differently, you know? They make you laugh, cry, and question the meaning of life, sometimes all in one episode."</p>
        <p>Bob: "Exactly! And the music, too. The opening themes are total bangers. I've added way too many to my workout playlist."</p>
        <p>Alice: "Mine too! So, what's next on your watch list? Are you diving into anything new?"</p>
        <p>Bob: "I'm thinking of checking out that new rom-com everyone's raving about, <em>My Dress-Up Darling</em>. Gotta expand my horizons beyond just shonen battles, right?"</p>
        <p>Alice: "Good choice! Prepare for maximum fluffiness. Maybe I'll finally finish <em>Chainsaw Man</em> and see what all the fuss is about."</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <div class="current-situation">
        <p>The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented 'new wave' of Japanese anime popularity. Unlike previous surges driven by a few blockbuster titles like <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> or <em>Sailor Moon</em>, this wave is characterized by its broad appeal across genres and demographics, fueled by global streaming platforms such as Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Disney+. High-quality animation, sophisticated storytelling, and a diverse range of themes – from complex fantasy and intense action to slice-of-life and romantic comedies – have captivated audiences worldwide.</p>
        <p>Anime is no longer a niche interest; it's a mainstream cultural phenomenon, influencing fashion, music, and social media trends. International box office successes for anime films, sold-out conventions, and a booming merchandise market further underscore its immense global impact, demonstrating its powerful position in the entertainment landscape.</p>
