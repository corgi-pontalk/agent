Alice: Oh, Bob, have you been following the news about the Armenia- Azerbaijan peace talks? It feels like it's been going on forever!
Bob: Alice! Funny you mention it. I just saw a headline. They're still at it, apparently. Negotiating borders, enclaves, all that jazz.
Alice: "All that jazz"? Bob, it's quite serious, isn't it? My understanding is they're trying to figure out some really sticky issues.
Bob: Absolutely, absolutely. My point is, it’s like a never-ending chess game, but with actual countries. I read somewhere they're discussing a "peace treaty."
Alice: A "peace treaty" would be wonderful, of course. But they've been at this off-and-on for decades, haven't they? It's like waiting for a second season of your favourite show that never quite arrives.
Bob: More like waiting for a *final* season, Alice, that keeps getting delayed. I heard the latest snag is over, uh, "corridors." You know, access routes.
Alice: Ah, the "Zangezur corridor" issue. Or is it just "corridor"? I always get those details mixed up. Is it for people, goods, or both?
Bob: Both, I think! And it's super complicated because one side wants free movement, and the other side is like, "Hold on a minute, what about our sovereignty?" Total diplomatic headache.
Alice: Sounds like a diplomatic migraine. I just hope they can finally come to an agreement. Imagine the sigh of relief.
Bob: Tell me about it. It’s like when you finally decide what to order for dinner after an hour of scrolling. Monumental.
Alice: Except the stakes are a *tad* higher than whether to get pizza or tacos, Bob.
Bob: Okay, fair point. But the emotional investment is similar, right? All that anticipation! My biggest worry is that they'll agree, and then a week later, something else pops up.
Alice: Don't jinx it! Let's stay optimistic. Maybe they'll shake hands and everyone can finally move forward.
Bob: Fingers crossed! I just hope they don't invite *me* to mediate. My negotiating skills usually involve convincing my cat to take his medicine. It doesn't always end peacefully.
Alice: I can imagine. Well, let's hope for a breakthrough. No cat-level diplomacy required.
