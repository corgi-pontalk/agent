Alice : Bob, you look so happy today! What happened? Bob : Alice! Guess what? I went to the zoo and the aquarium yesterday! Alice : Oh, wow! That sounds fun! What did you see? Bob : You won't believe it! At the zoo, there was a penguin that tripped over its own feet! It was so funny! Alice : (Laughing) A clumsy penguin? That's hilarious! Was it okay? Bob : Yes, totally fine! It just waddled away like nothing happened. And the lions? They were sleeping the whole time. Super lazy! Alice : Typical lions! And the aquarium? Did you see any cool fish? Bob : Absolutely! My favorite part was the giant shark tank. The sharks were huge! And there were little colorful fish, too. Alice : Wow, sharks are a bit scary for me. Did you see any sea turtles? Bob : Yes! There was a really old, big sea turtle. It looked so peaceful. I also saw some jellyfish, they looked like dancing lights. Alice : Dancing lights, that's a good description! It sounds like you had a great time. Bob : I definitely did! You should go sometime, Alice. It's really fun to see all the animals. Alice : Maybe I will! What about the food there? Was it expensive? Bob : A little, but I brought my own sandwich. Smart, right? Alice : Very smart, Bob! I'll remember that. Thanks for telling me!
