    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hi Bob! Welcome back! How was your trip? And how was customs?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Hey Alice! The trip was amazing, but customs... that was an adventure!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh no, why? Did you try to bring back a pet llama again?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Haha, no! This time it was just a really long line. And the officer looked very serious.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: A serious officer? Did you look suspicious, Bob? Like you were hiding a thousand chocolate bars?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Maybe! My suitcase was pretty full. He asked, "What is the purpose of your visit?"</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: What did you say? "World chocolate tasting tour"?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: I said, "Tourism, sir." Then he asked, "Do you have anything to declare?"</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, the dreaded question! What did you have? Ten miniature Eiffel Towers?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Only two! And a giant novelty cheese grater. I almost declared it, but then I remembered it wasn't actually cheese.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Haha! Did he ask for your passport and boarding pass?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Yes, of course. He looked at them for a long time. I started sweating!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Phew! Sounds stressful. Did you fill out a declaration form too?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Yes, I did. Always fill out the form carefully! It asks about what you brought.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: So, no smuggled llamas, just a cheese grater adventure? Glad you made it back safely! Now, coffee?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Coffee sounds perfect, Alice! My customs adventure needs a happy ending.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>When you travel to another country by plane, train, or ship, you need to go through <strong>customs</strong>. Customs is a place at the border or airport where officials check your bags and documents. They want to make sure you are not bringing anything illegal into the country and that you declare any items that might require special taxes or restrictions.</p>
    <p>A <strong>customs officer</strong> might ask you questions like "What is the purpose of your visit?" (Why are you here?) or "Do you have anything to declare?" (Do you have items like large amounts of money, alcohol, tobacco, or certain foods that need to be reported?). You usually need to show your <strong>passport</strong> (your official travel document) and sometimes a <strong>boarding pass</strong> (your ticket for the flight). You might also need to fill out a <strong>declaration form</strong>, which is a paper asking about the things you are bringing into the country.</p>
    <p>It can feel a little bit scary or stressful, especially if there's a <strong>long line</strong>, but it's a normal part of international travel to keep everyone safe!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. The Simple Past Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the <strong>Simple Past Tense</strong> to talk about actions or situations that happened and finished in the past. We often use it when telling a story or describing past events.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular verbs:</strong> Add '-ed' to the base form (e.g., walk &rarr; walked, ask &rarr; asked, look &rarr; looked).
                <ul><li><em>Example:</em> The officer <strong>asked</strong> me many questions.</li></ul></li>
            <li><strong>Irregular verbs:</strong> These verbs change their form completely (e.g., go &rarr; went, have &rarr; had, be &rarr; was/were, say &rarr; said).
                <ul><li><em>Example:</em> The trip <strong>was</strong> amazing.</li>
                    <li><em>Example:</em> I <strong>said</strong>, "Tourism, sir."</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To make a negative sentence, use <strong>did not (didn't) + base form of the verb</strong>.</p>
        <ul><li><em>Example:</em> I <strong>didn't bring</strong> a pet llama.</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. Asking Questions in the Past Tense (Wh- questions and Yes/No questions)</h3>
        <p>When you want to ask about past events, you can use different types of questions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wh- questions (What, How, Why)</strong>: Use these to ask for specific information.
                <ul><li><strong>What</strong> did you do? / <strong>How</strong> was your trip? / <strong>Why</strong> did you go?</li>
                    <li><em>Dialogue Example:</em> "<strong>How was</strong> your trip?"</li>
                    <li><em>Dialogue Example:</em> "<strong>What is</strong> the purpose of your visit?" (Here, 'is' is used because it asks about the general purpose, not necessarily a past action of purpose-having).</li></ul></li>
            <li><strong>Yes/No questions (Did you...?)</strong>: Use <strong>Did + subject + base form of verb</strong> to ask questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no".
                <ul><li><em>Example:</em> <strong>Did you see</strong> the Eiffel Tower? (Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.)</li>
                    <li><em>Dialogue Example:</em> "<strong>Did you try</strong> to bring back a pet llama?"</li>
                    <li><em>Dialogue Example:</em> "<strong>Did he ask</strong> for your passport?"</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Verb "To Be" in the Past Tense (was/were)</h3>
        <p>The verb "to be" is very common. In the past tense, it changes to <strong>was</strong> (for I, he, she, it) or <strong>were</strong> (for you, we, they).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I <strong>was</strong>, He <strong>was</strong>, She <strong>was</strong>, It <strong>was</strong></li>
            <li>You <strong>were</strong>, We <strong>were</strong>, They <strong>were</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Dialogue Example:</em> "The trip <strong>was</strong> amazing."</li>
            <li><em>Dialogue Example:</em> "My suitcase <strong>was</strong> pretty full."</li>
            <li><em>Example:</em> They <strong>were</strong> very tired after the flight.</li>
        </ul>
