Alice: Bob, guess what I saw today?
Bob: What, Alice? Another squirrel trying to pay for coffee?
Alice: No, but close! I saw someone arguing with a traffic light. Like, _really_ arguing.
Bob: Haha! That's a classic case of... uh... 'social deviance' maybe?
Alice: Social deviance? Is that a fancy way of saying 'crazy person'?
Bob: Well, in sociology, it means acting differently from what society usually expects. Like, most people don't yell at traffic lights.
Alice: So, the 'rules' for acting are called 'social norms' then?
Bob: Exactly! Like waiting in line at the store. That's a social norm.
Alice: Oh, I get it! So, when I pretend not to see someone I know in a supermarket to avoid talking, is that a social norm?
Bob: That's a 'social strategy'! But avoiding people isn't a _norm_... unless you're a secret agent.
Alice: What about 'social roles'? Like, you're a student, I'm a barista. Is that a social role?
Bob: Yes! And when we're together, we have the role of 'friends'. We act differently with friends than with our boss, right?
Alice: Totally! I wouldn't ask my boss if they want to share my giant cookie.
Bob: See? Different roles, different expectations. It's like a play, but everyone is a character.
Alice: Wow, Bob, you're surprisingly good at explaining this 'sociology stuff'! Maybe you should teach a class.
Bob: Nah, I just pay attention in class. Want to study social interaction over coffee?
Alice: Only if we don't argue with the coffee machine!
