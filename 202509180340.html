    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Bob, you won't believe the nightmare I had last night about AI!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, Alice? Was it about a robot uprising, or did ChatGPT just write your grocery list with philosophical musings about kale?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Worse! It was about deepfakes of my cat singing opera. The ethical implications were haunting.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Deepfakes of cats singing opera? Now *that's* a novel ethical dilemma. But seriously, the real concerns are pretty significant.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Exactly! I was thinking about things like <strong>bias in AI algorithms</strong>. What if an AI judge gives harsher sentences because it was trained on skewed data?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> That's a huge one. Or the whole issue of <strong>job displacement</strong>. My cousin, who's a graphic designer, is already worried about AI art generators.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Totally understandable. And what about <strong>copyright infringement</strong>? If an AI 'learns' from millions of copyrighted images, who owns the AI-generated output?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Good point. It's a <strong>legal minefield</strong>. And then there's <strong>misinformation and propaganda</strong>. Imagine AI-generated news articles that sound totally real but are completely made up.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Don't even get me started on the potential for <strong>malicious use</strong>. Imagine an AI that can craft super-convincing phishing emails tailored to your social media profile.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Now *that's* genuinely scary. It makes you wonder about <strong>accountability and responsibility</strong>. If an AI makes a harmful decision, who's to blame?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Is it the developer? The user? The AI itself? We need clear frameworks for <strong>AI ethics and governance</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Definitely. It feels like we're building these powerful tools without fully understanding the long-term societal impact.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> It's a <strong>double-edged sword</strong>, isn't it? So much potential for good, but also so many pitfalls.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Agreed. Maybe we should start a support group for humans grappling with the future of AI. Our first meeting could involve therapy pets... preferably not deepfaked ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Deal! But only if they bring snacks. Real, non-AI-generated snacks.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, audio, and video, often in response to simple prompts. While these technologies offer immense potential for creativity, efficiency, and problem-solving, their rapid advancement has brought forth a complex array of ethical concerns.</p>
    <p>Key issues include the pervasive problem of <strong>bias in AI algorithms</strong>, which can perpetuate or even amplify existing societal prejudices if trained on unrepresentative or skewed data. This can lead to unfair outcomes in critical areas like employment, justice, and healthcare. Another major concern is <strong>job displacement</strong>, as AI tools increasingly automate tasks traditionally performed by humans, raising questions about economic equity and workforce adaptation.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the creation of convincing <strong>deepfakes</strong> and the spread of AI-generated <strong>misinformation and propaganda</strong> pose significant threats to trust in media, democratic processes, and personal reputations. Questions surrounding <strong>copyright infringement</strong> and intellectual property ownership are also emerging, as AI models learn from vast datasets, often without clear attribution or compensation to original creators. Finally, establishing clear lines of <strong>accountability and responsibility</strong> when AI systems make harmful decisions remains a substantial challenge, underscoring the urgent need for robust <strong>AI ethics and governance</strong> frameworks globally.</p>
