Alice: Oh, Bob, thank goodness it's you! I'm having a bit of a crisis, Alice.
Bob: Crisis? Did your coffee machine stop working? That _is_ serious.
Alice: Worse! I’m trying to book that cat yoga class for Saturday, but this website is just… _mrrrow_!
Bob: Cat yoga? You’re serious? I thought that was a joke! What’s the problem with the booking?
Alice: It keeps saying "invalid number of purrs"! No, wait, it says "invalid date format." How do I even _choose_ the date?
Bob: Haha! "Invalid number of purrs" – I like that! Let me see. Is it asking for MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY?
Alice: It just has a little calendar icon. I click it, but then nothing happens. My screen looks like a frozen kitten!
Bob: Hmm, maybe it's a pop-up blocker. Or perhaps your browser is a little sleepy. Let me try on my phone.
Alice: Oh, could you? I really want to go. The website said they only have two spots left!
Bob: Okay, I’m on the website now. "Cat Yoga Studio," looking good... Ah, I see the date picker. Let’s try October 26th.
Alice: Yes, that’s the one! Did it work? Is it asking for my credit card now?
Bob: Almost there! It’s asking for your email for confirmation. And then, yes, payment details.
Alice: Perfect! You’re a lifesaver, Bob! My Saturday purr-fectly saved!
Bob: Any time, Alice! Just be ready for some serious stretching. And maybe some actual cat naps.
Alice: Don't worry, I've been practicing my downward-facing cat pose. Thanks again!
