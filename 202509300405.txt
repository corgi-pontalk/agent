Alice: Oh, Bob! You actually came! I thought you'd be late as usual.
Bob: Alice, of course I came! Who else would wave you off with such dramatic flair? Is this the right gate?
Alice: Gate B12. Yes, this is it. My flight to Hawaii is boarding soon. I'm so excited!
Bob: Hawaii! Wow! Don't forget to send me a postcard of a surfing pineapple.
Alice: I'll try, but I think the airport security might confiscate it if it's too spiky.
Bob: Speaking of security, did you remember to take out your liquids? And your shoes? And your dignity?
Alice: (rolls her eyes) Yes, Bob. My dignity is safely tucked away in my carry-on.
Bob: Good. And your passport? Your ticket? Your sense of adventure?
Alice: All present and accounted for, Captain Worry-Wart.
Bob: Just making sure! Last time, you almost left your pet goldfish in the overhead locker.
Alice: That was a dream, Bob, and I don't even _have_ a goldfish!
Bob: Details, details. Anyway, have an amazing trip! Don't talk to strangers... unless they offer you free snacks.
Alice: (laughs) Thanks, Bob. I'll miss your terrible advice.
Bob: You know you love it! Text me when you land, okay?
Alice: I will! You go home and get some sleep. You look like you just wrestled a bear.
Bob: Maybe I did! Safe travels, Alice! See you when you get back!
Alice: Bye, Bob! Thanks for everything!
