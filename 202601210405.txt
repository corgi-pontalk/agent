Alice: Bob, hey! What are you doing with that banana peel?
Bob: Oh, hi Alice! I was just about to put it in... the garbage.
Alice: The garbage? Bob, we have a compost bin! Don't you remember the big green one?
Bob: Oh, right! The one that smells like... future soil? My bad. I always forget which bin is for what.
Alice: It's okay. It takes practice! And this plastic bottle? This goes in the blue recycling bin.
Bob: Blue bin, got it. So, green for bananas, blue for bottles... What about this old shoe?
Alice: A shoe? Hmm, that's tricky. Not recycling, not compost. Maybe donation? Or just regular trash if it's really broken.
Bob: Sustainability is hard work! My head is spinning with all these rules.
Alice: It's not _that_ hard. Just think: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle!
Bob: Reduce... my coffee intake? Reuse... this coffee cup for water? Recycle... my socks?
Alice: (Laughs) You're trying! Reduce means use less new stuff. Reuse means use things again. Like your coffee cup!
Bob: Ah, so my reusable coffee cup is a superhero!
Alice: Exactly! And when you shop, remember your reusable bag. No plastic bags, please!
Bob: Right. Reusable bag... I left mine in the car. Oops.
Alice: It's a learning process. Every small step helps save the planet.
Bob: So, no more putting glass bottles in the paper recycling bin?
Alice: Definitely not! That's a big no-no.
Bob: Got it. Green for future soil, blue for plastic, no glass with paper, and my coffee cup is a superhero. I think I'm getting it!
Alice: Good job, Bob! Now, let's find that compost bin for your banana peel.
