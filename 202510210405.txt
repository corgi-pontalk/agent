Alice : Bob? Is that really you hiding behind that enormous book? Bob : Alice! Hi! Uh, yes. I'm on a top-secret mission. Alice : A top-secret mission... in the children's picture book section? Bob : It's research! For my... *imagination*. Alice : Right. And I suppose that's why you have a unicorn sticker on your nose? Bob : Uh, artistic expression! It just... *popped* on. Alice : Okay, Mr. Imagination. What are you actually looking for? Bob : I'm trying to find a book about... how to train a very stubborn goldfish. Alice : A goldfish? Bob, goldfish usually just swim and eat. Bob : Mine looks like it's plotting world domination. I need instructions! Alice : I think you might be in the wrong section. Maybe try 'Pets' or 'Fantasy'? Bob : Good idea! Or maybe 'Advanced Aquatic Psychology'? Alice : Let's stick with 'Pets' for now. Do you need help finding it? Bob : Yes, please! My goldfish, Bartholomew, is counting on me. Alice : Bartholomew, huh? Come on, Bob. Let's save the world... or at least Bartholomew's world.
