Alice: Bob, guess what just popped up on my feed!
Bob: Alice, if it's another cat video, I swear I'm going to unfollow you.
Alice: Even better! The Global Art Biennale 2025 dates just dropped!
Bob: No way! Already? I thought we had more time to mentally prepare for the 'what even *is* that?' phase.
Alice: Exactly! Remember that installation last time that looked suspiciously like a giant pile of forgotten laundry?
Bob: Oh, the 'Existential Socks of Our Times' piece? Groundbreaking. Or just... dirty. Hard to tell.
Alice: And then there was the performance art where a guy just stared at a wall for three hours.
Bob: I related to that on a spiritual level, actually. Felt like a typical Tuesday morning at my desk.
Alice: This year, I'm hoping for something a little less... interpretive, and a little more 'wow, that's pretty!'
Bob: Dream on, my friend. It's a biennale. The more obscure, the better. I'm already mentally preparing my 'hmm, yes, I see the profound commentary on consumerism' face.
Alice: You always do that! And then you spend twenty minutes trying to figure out if it's actual art or just a misplaced fire extinguisher.
Bob: It's part of the experience! Adds to the mystery. Are we going, by the way? I need to start growing my 'art connoisseur' beard.
Alice: Of course we're going! You can shave that beard if it gets too itchy. I hear there might be a giant inflatable squirrel this year.
Bob: A *squirrel*? Now that's what I call cutting-edge. Sign me up! Maybe it'll be gnawing on the existential socks.
Alice: Let's hope not. We don't want a repeat of the 'Mysterious Disappearance of the Curator's Lunch' incident.
