    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Hey Bob, have you been following all the news about AI in healthcare? It's wild!</p>
        <p>Bob: Yeah Alice, it sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie! Next thing you know, our doctors will be shiny robots.</p>
        <p>Alice: Totally! Imagine a robot doctor giving you a check-up. No more awkward small talk or trying to explain that mysterious "twinge" in your elbow.</p>
        <p>Bob: Or worse, diagnosing you with a "severe case of Mondayitis" and prescribing more coffee. Though, to be fair, that might actually help sometimes!</p>
        <p>Alice: *laughs* But seriously, the **breakthroughs** are incredible. Early disease detection, **personalized treatment plans** based on your DNA... it's like a superpower for medicine.</p>
        <p>Bob: True, but what about the risks? I heard about an AI that mistook a banana for a tumor in a training image. Just kidding... mostly. But what if it makes a serious mistake?</p>
        <p>Alice: **Data privacy** is a huge one for me. I don't want my entire medical history uploaded to the cloud and then accidentally sold to a company that only offers sad clown therapy.</p>
        <p>Bob: Exactly! And if an AI makes a mistake, who's **liable**? The AI, the programmer, or the person who plugged it in? We can't just **blindly trust** a **black box algorithm** with our lives.</p>
        <p>Alice: Good point. The lack of transparency in some AI systems is definitely a concern. It’s not like you can ask the robot doctor for a second opinion in a way that truly questions its core logic.</p>
        <p>Bob: But imagine, Alice, no more endless waiting rooms! You just walk into a scanning pod, it zaps you, and *poof* – diagnosis in seconds. Think of the efficiency!</p>
        <p>Alice: Sounds amazing, like something out of Star Trek. But also a bit impersonal, don't you think? Sometimes you need a human to tell you everything's going to be okay.</p>
        <p>Bob: Maybe, but if it means faster cures and more affordable care for everyone, I'm all for it. Just don't let it decide my lunch menu. My arteries need to live a little.</p>
        <p>Alice: Or replace human empathy. A comforting **bedside manner** still matters, even if an AI is 99.9% accurate. We're not just data points.</p>
        <p>Bob: Agreed. So, a **hybrid approach**? AI assists doctors, handling the complex data analysis, but humans keep the compassionate care.</p>
        <p>Alice: Precisely! AI for the brains, humans for the heart. Now, about that coffee prescription for my Mondayitis...</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>AI in healthcare is rapidly moving from science fiction to reality, with significant advancements being made across various sectors. Currently, AI is playing a transformative role in several key areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics and Imaging:</strong> AI algorithms are being used to analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) with remarkable accuracy, often identifying diseases like cancer or retinopathy earlier than human eyes. They also assist pathologists in analyzing tissue samples.</li>
        <li><strong>Drug Discovery and Development:</strong> AI accelerates the identification of potential drug candidates, predicts their efficacy and toxicity, and optimizes clinical trial designs, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with bringing new medicines to market.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Medicine:</strong> By analyzing vast amounts of patient data, including genetic information, lifestyle, and medical history, AI can help tailor treatment plans to individual patients, leading to more effective and targeted therapies.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI models can predict disease outbreaks, patient deterioration, or the risk of readmission, allowing healthcare providers to intervene proactively.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Health Assistants:</strong> AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are used for patient support, answering questions, managing appointments, and providing remote monitoring, improving access to care.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, alongside these breakthroughs, significant risks and challenges persist. These include concerns about **data privacy and security**, as medical information is highly sensitive. The potential for **algorithmic bias** (where AI reflects biases present in its training data) can lead to health disparities. There are also ethical dilemmas surrounding **accountability** for AI errors, the impact on healthcare employment, and the need for robust **regulatory frameworks** to ensure safety and efficacy. Balancing innovation with responsible deployment remains a critical task for the healthcare industry and policymakers.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Speculation and Possibility (could, might, may, can)</h3>
    <p>Modal verbs like 'could', 'might', 'may', and 'can' are used to express varying degrees of possibility, probability, or speculation about present or future situations. They are followed by the base form of the verb.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Could</strong>: Expresses possibility or ability. (e.g., "AI *could* revolutionize diagnostics.")</li>
        <li><strong>Might / May</strong>: Express a weaker possibility, meaning there is a chance it will happen. (e.g., "It *might* make mistakes." "A robot *may* replace human doctors entirely, but it's unlikely.")</li>
        <li><strong>Can</strong>: Often used to express general possibility or ability. (e.g., "AI *can* help create personalized treatment plans.")</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 & 2)</h3>
    <p>Conditional sentences discuss hypothetical situations and their consequences. The dialogue uses them to explore potential outcomes of AI in healthcare.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type 1 (Real Conditional)</strong>: Used for real or very probable situations in the present or future.
            <br>Structure: If + Present Simple, Future Simple (will/can/may/might + base verb).
            <br><em>Example: "If AI diagnoses faster, patients *will get* treatment sooner."</em></li>
        <li><strong>Type 2 (Unreal Conditional)</strong>: Used for hypothetical or improbable situations in the present or future.
            <br>Structure: If + Past Simple, would/could/might + base verb.
            <br><em>Example: "What if an AI *made* a serious mistake?" (meaning, if this unlikely event happened)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Gerunds as Nouns</h3>
    <p>A gerund is a verb form ending in -ing that functions as a noun. They can be the subject, object, or complement of a sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subject: "*Diagnosing* diseases early is a major benefit."</li>
        <li>Object: "No more *waiting* rooms." (object of the preposition "more")</li>
        <li>Object: "We can't just blindly trust a black box algorithm with our *lives*." (The verb "trust" takes "algorithm" as its direct object, but this phrase is about *dealing* with our lives) - a better example from the text is "trying to *explain* that mysterious 'twinge'" where explain is a gerund object of 'trying to'.</li>
        <li>A clear example from the text: "no more awkward small talk or <strong>trying</strong> to explain that mysterious 'twinge'". Here, 'trying' acts as a noun describing the action.</li>
    </ul>
