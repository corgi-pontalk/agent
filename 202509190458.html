    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob, you won't believe what I just read about cybersecurity threats for 2025!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice, don't tell me it's another one of those 'AI will steal your thoughts' articles. My smart toaster already tried to hold my crumpets for ransom last week.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: No, seriously! They're talking about AI-powered deepfakes that can mimic your voice and video perfectly. Imagine your boss calling you, but it’s actually a scammer!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Huh. So I could just blame all my missed deadlines on a deepfake of my boss giving me a day off? Interesting strategy.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bob! This is serious! And what about ransomware? They say it’ll be targeting smart homes. Your fridge could lock itself until you pay up!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: My fridge already judges my snack choices. A ransom note would just be its next passive-aggressive move. "Pay 0.05 Bitcoin or no more ice cream!"</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: But think about the Internet of Things – all our smart devices are potential weak points. Your doorbell could be hacked to spy on you, or your thermostat could crank up the heat to tropical levels!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Tropical levels? My cat would *love* that. She's always wanted a mini-jungle. Maybe it's not all bad.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: You're impossible! They also mentioned advanced phishing scams. AI will make them so convincing, you won't even realize you're clicking a malicious link.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: So, less 'Nigerian Prince' and more 'Your long-lost rich aunt who just happens to be a supermodel needs your help with a minor bank transfer'? Got it. I'll just assume everyone's trying to trick me.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: That's not a bad approach, actually! We need to be more vigilant. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication...</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: And maybe a tinfoil hat for my smart speaker? Just in case it starts plotting world domination with my vacuum cleaner?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: (Sighs) You're making light of a very real danger! Our digital footprint is getting bigger, and so are the risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I know, I know. I’m just trying to keep my panic levels down. But seriously, it sounds like we’re heading into a cyber jungle out there.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! So maybe let's update our software and practice identifying suspicious emails together?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Deal. As long as we start with your smart toaster. It's giving me suspicious side-eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, and 2025 is projected to see a significant escalation in sophistication and impact. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a dual role, both as a tool for defense and a powerful weapon for attackers. We can expect to see AI-powered phishing campaigns that generate highly convincing, personalized emails and messages, making them exceedingly difficult to detect. Deepfake technology, using AI to create realistic fake audio and video, will become a major concern, enabling advanced social engineering scams that could impersonate individuals for fraud or disinformation.</p>
    <p>Ransomware attacks are anticipated to become even more pervasive, targeting not just large corporations and critical infrastructure, but also expanding to vulnerable smart home devices and the broader Internet of Things (IoT). The interconnectedness of our devices provides numerous entry points for malicious actors. Supply chain attacks, where attackers compromise a less secure vendor to gain access to a larger target, will also remain a significant threat.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, state-sponsored cyber espionage and warfare are expected to intensify, focusing on data theft, sabotage, and disruption of essential services. The human element continues to be the weakest link, with social engineering tactics remaining highly effective. Education, robust multi-factor authentication, regular software updates, and advanced threat detection systems will be crucial defenses in this increasingly complex digital landscape.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity threats</strong>: The government issued a warning about new cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-powered deepfakes</strong>: Beware of AI-powered deepfakes; they can be incredibly hard to distinguish from real content.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing campaign</strong>: The company launched an awareness program to educate employees about identifying phishing campaigns.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware attack</strong>: A recent ransomware attack caused widespread disruption, locking users out of their data.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) devices</strong>: Smart speakers, cameras, and thermostats are common examples of IoT devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: The software patch addressed a critical security vulnerability that hackers could exploit.</li>
        <li><strong>Social engineering</strong>: Many cyber breaches succeed due to clever social engineering tactics that manipulate people.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital footprint</strong>: Every online action contributes to your digital footprint, so be mindful of what you share.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong>: Always enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Malicious link</strong>: Clicking on a malicious link can install malware or lead to a phishing website.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. Modal Verbs for Prediction and Possibility</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs like <em>will</em>, <em>might</em>, <em>could</em>, and <em>may</em> are often used when discussing future trends, predictions, or possibilities, especially in the context of emerging threats.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Will</strong>: Expresses a strong prediction or certainty about the future.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "They say it <strong>will</strong> be targeting smart homes."</p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Another example:</em> "AI <strong>will</strong> make them so convincing."</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Might / Could / May</strong>: Express uncertainty, possibility, or less strong predictions.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Your fridge <strong>could</strong> lock itself until you pay up!"</p>
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Another example:</em> "Your doorbell <strong>could</strong> be hacked to spy on you."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>2. The Passive Voice</h3>
        <p>The passive voice is frequently used when the action is more important than the actor, or when the actor is unknown or obvious. In cybersecurity contexts, it's common when describing what <em>happens</em> to systems or data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Subject + form of 'to be' + past participle.</li>
            <li><p class="example-sentence"><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Your doorbell <strong>could be hacked</strong> to spy on you." (Focus is on the hacking, not who does it.)</p></li>
            <li><p class="example-sentence"><em>More examples:</em> "Systems <strong>were compromised</strong>." "Data <strong>is being stolen</strong> every day." "Vulnerabilities <strong>are often exploited</strong> by attackers."</p></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>3. Phrasal Verbs in Context</h3>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with a preposition or an adverb (or both) to create a new meaning. They are common in informal English and often appear in conversations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fall for (something)</strong>: To be deceived by something, to believe a trick.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> "He almost <strong>fell for</strong> a phishing scam."</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Look out for (something/someone)</strong>: To be careful and watch for something or someone.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example:</em> "We need to <strong>look out for</strong> suspicious emails."</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pay up</strong>: To pay money that is owed or demanded.
                <p class="example-sentence"><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "Your fridge could lock itself until you <strong>pay up</strong>!"</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
