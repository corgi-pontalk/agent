Alice: Hi Bob! Welcome back! How was your trip? And how was customs?
Bob: Hey Alice! The trip was amazing, but customs... that was an adventure!
Alice: Oh no, why? Did you try to bring back a pet llama again?
Bob: Haha, no! This time it was just a really long line. And the officer looked very serious.
Alice: A serious officer? Did you look suspicious, Bob? Like you were hiding a thousand chocolate bars?
Bob: Maybe! My suitcase was pretty full. He asked, "What is the purpose of your visit?"
Alice: What did you say? "World chocolate tasting tour"?
Bob: I said, "Tourism, sir." Then he asked, "Do you have anything to declare?"
Alice: Oh, the dreaded question! What did you have? Ten miniature Eiffel Towers?
Bob: Only two! And a giant novelty cheese grater. I almost declared it, but then I remembered it wasn't actually cheese.
Alice: Haha! Did he ask for your passport and boarding pass?
Bob: Yes, of course. He looked at them for a long time. I started sweating!
Alice: Phew! Sounds stressful. Did you fill out a declaration form too?
Bob: Yes, I did. Always fill out the form carefully! It asks about what you brought.
Alice: So, no smuggled llamas, just a cheese grater adventure? Glad you made it back safely! Now, coffee?
Bob: Coffee sounds perfect, Alice! My customs adventure needs a happy ending.
