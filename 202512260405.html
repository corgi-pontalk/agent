        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! You look stressed. Everything okay?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, Bob! Just another Tuesday, drowning in emails.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Emails? Already? It's barely 9 AM!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Tell me about it! My inbox is a black hole. Things go in, but they never truly come out.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Haha, I know the feeling. Did you see Sarah's email about the "urgent" cake order?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: The one with the subject line 'URGENT: Sugar Emergency'?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: That's the one! I almost replied with 'URGENT: Send Coffee'.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: I saw! And then Mark 'replied all' asking if it was gluten-free. Seriously?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Of course he did! It's like email etiquette goes out the window when cake is involved.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Exactly! And don't even get me started on the passive-aggressive emails. "Just a friendly reminder..." when it really means "You forgot!"</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Oh, those! Or the ones that are a single sentence. "See attached." That's it!</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Or the really long ones that make you scroll for ages. I need a TL;DR button for work emails.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: What's TL;DR?</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Too Long; Didn't Read! It's an internet thing. Very useful for overly detailed reports.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Haha, I should start using that. My boss might get confused though.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Probably! But seriously, how do you handle your inbox?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I try to keep subject lines clear and reply promptly. And I never, ever 'reply all' unless absolutely necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good advice, Bob. Maybe I should implement a 'no cake-related email' policy for myself.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Good luck with that, Alice! See you later!</p>
