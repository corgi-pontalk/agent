        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Bob, you ate the last cookie! That's a human rights violation, in my book!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Alice, it was <i>one</i> cookie! And it was in <i>my</i> hand. That's called 'possession'!</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: But I had 'the right to snack'! Everyone has the right to access delicious baked goods!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Is 'snack rights' really a thing? I thought human rights were, like, more serious.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: They are! But the principle applies! Like 'the right to food' &ndash; cookies count!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Okay, okay, you've got a point about food. But what about my right to peace and quiet? You were playing your music super loud yesterday.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: That's 'freedom of expression' through dance music! And you have the right to ask me to turn it down, which you did, and I did!</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: True. So, it's about balancing rights, then?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Exactly! My right to loud music doesn't mean I can ignore your right to sleep.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: So, if I want to use the TV, and you're watching your K-drama for the tenth time...</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: We negotiate! My right to binge-watch vs. your right to... sports? News?</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: My right to <i>anything else</i>! So, the 'right to choose' what to watch?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Yes! And the 'right to equality' means we both get fair turns.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: Wow, you're making 'human rights' sound like our roommate agreement.</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: In a way, it is! Just on a much, much bigger scale, for <i>everyone</i>.</p>
        <p><b>Bob</b>: So, no more cookie theft, then?</p>
        <p><b>Alice</b>: Definitely a step in the right direction for 'cookie justice'!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Human rights are basic rights and freedoms that belong to every person in the world, from birth until death. They protect us and ensure we can live with dignity. These rights include the right to life, freedom, equality, education, work, and food. The idea is that everyone, everywhere, should have these fundamental protections.</p>
    <p>Many of these rights are listed in a document called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), created by the United Nations. While great progress has been made, many people around the world still face challenges in enjoying their full human rights, making it an ongoing and important global issue.</p>
