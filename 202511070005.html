    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-container">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Bob, did you see that article about biodiversity loss? It's pretty grim, even for 2025!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice, grim is an understatement! I'm already imagining a world where the only 'wildlife' is my dust bunny collection under the sofa.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Don't be so dramatic! Though I did read we might be losing entire species we haven't even discovered yet. Talk about a missed opportunity for a cute new internet meme.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right? No new weird-looking deep-sea fish to go viral. The internet generation will never know the joy of a blobfish.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: And imagine a world without chocolate! Cacao trees are apparently quite sensitive. That's where I draw the line.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: No chocolate? Okay, now it's personal. This biodiversity thing just went from 'sad' to 'apocalyptic.' Are we talking about a world without coffee too?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Potentially! Different coffee bean varieties are at risk. We might be stuck with just one kind, forever. Think of the horror!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: One kind of coffee? That's not a future, Alice, that's a dystopian novel I don't want to read. I need my artisanal single-origin pour-over!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Well, start appreciating those bees now. Pollinators are crucial for so much of our food. Without them, say goodbye to apples, almonds, and probably even that fancy coffee.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: My artisanal single-origin pour-over, threatened by the absence of a tiny fuzzy creature? This is tragic on so many levels. I should have been nicer to that bee that flew into my kitchen last week.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It's not just about the cute animals, though. Think about the entire ecosystems collapsing. Like dominoes, but with more existential dread.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Existential dread and no chocolate? This is a recipe for a very grumpy future Bob. Maybe I should start a bee sanctuary in my backyard. Operation Save My Latte!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: That's the spirit! Every little bit helps. Even just planting native flowers can make a difference for local pollinators.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: So, instead of doomscrolling, I should be 'bloom-scrolling'? I like it. My garden will become a haven for tiny, crucial creatures. And maybe, just maybe, save my chocolate supply.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! Who knew saving the planet could involve so much gardening and less existential despair?</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Biodiversity loss refers to the reduction of living organisms of all kinds, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. In 2025, the world continues to face an accelerated rate of species extinction, far exceeding natural rates. This isn't just about losing individual species; it's about the collapse of entire ecosystems that provide essential services like clean air, water, food, and medicine.</p>
    <p>The primary drivers include habitat destruction (due to agriculture, urbanization, and resource extraction), climate change, pollution, overexploitation of resources (like overfishing and deforestation), and the spread of invasive species. The consequences are dire, threatening food security (as seen with declining pollinator populations), the discovery of new medicines, and the stability of natural systems that sustain human life. Urgent and concerted global action is required to mitigate these losses and protect the intricate web of life on Earth.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-points">
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Present Perfect Continuous (for ongoing situations)</strong>
                <p>This tense describes an action or situation that began in the past and is still continuing in the present, often emphasizing the duration of the activity.</p>
                <p><em>Structure:</em> subject + have/has + been + verb-ing</p>
                <p><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "I'm already imagining a world where the only 'wildlife' is my dust bunny collection under the sofa." (This is more an immediate reaction, but the idea of 'imagining' can be ongoing)</p>
                <p><em>General Example:</em> "Scientists <strong>have been observing</strong> the decline in bee populations for years." (The observation started in the past and continues.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Modal Verbs for Speculation/Possibility (<em>might, could</em>)</strong>
                <p>These verbs are used to express varying degrees of certainty or possibility about present or future events. "Might" suggests a possibility, while "could" often suggests a slightly weaker or more remote possibility, or an ability/potential.</p>
                <p><em>Structure:</em> subject + might/could + base verb</p>
                <p><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "We <strong>might be losing</strong> entire species." (Possibility)</p>
                <p><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "We <strong>might be stuck</strong> with just one kind [of coffee]." (Possibility)</p>
                <p><em>General Example:</em> "If we don't act soon, we <strong>could lose</strong> many valuable natural resources."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Phrasal Verb: "Draw the line"</strong>
                <p>This idiom means to set a limit or boundary beyond which something is considered unacceptable or intolerable.</p>
                <p><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "No chocolate? Cacao trees are apparently quite sensitive. That's where I <strong>draw the line</strong>."</p>
                <p><em>General Example:</em> "I can tolerate a lot of noise, but playing loud music after midnight is where I <strong>draw the line</strong>."</p>
