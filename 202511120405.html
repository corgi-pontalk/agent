        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey Bob, ready for our beach trip tomorrow?</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: Alice! Oh, totally! I've been dreaming of <em class="vocab">sand</em>, <em class="vocab">sun</em>, and... well, not getting sunburnt.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha, don't forget the <em class="vocab">sunscreen</em>! I'm bringing my big <em class="vocab">beach towel</em> and a fun inflatable <em class="vocab">flamingo</em>.</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: A flamingo? Classic Alice! I just hope there are some good <em class="vocab">waves</em> for my new <em class="vocab">boogie board</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, are you going to try <em class="vocab">surfing</em>? Or just float around near the <em class="vocab">shore</em>?</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: Definitely floating. Surfing looks like too much work. I just want to relax under a <em class="vocab">beach umbrella</em> with a cool drink.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good plan! I'm planning to collect some <em class="vocab">seashells</em> and maybe even build a <em class="vocab">sandcastle</em>.</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: A sandcastle? Are you five? I was thinking of looking for some <em class="vocab">crabs</em> in the <em class="vocab">rock pools</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hey, sandcastles are an art form! And crabs are sneaky. Don't let them pinch you!</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: I'll be careful! Do you think we'll see any <em class="vocab">fish</em> if we go <em class="vocab">snorkeling</em>?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe! I packed my <em class="vocab">swimsuit</em> and <em class="vocab">goggles</em>. We can definitely try snorkeling.</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: Awesome! Just promise me you won't make me bury you in the <em class="vocab">sand</em>. My back still hurts from last time.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: No promises! But I did bring a <em class="vocab">beach ball</em>. We could play some <em class="vocab">volleyball</em>!</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: Volleyball sounds fun! Just no burying, deal?</p>
            <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Deal! See you tomorrow, Bob. Don't forget your <em class="vocab">flip-flops</em>!</p>
            <p><em class="speaker">Bob</em>: You too, Alice! And my <em class="vocab">sunglasses</em>!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Imagine a sunny day, warm sand, and the soothing sound of waves! Going to the beach is a fantastic way to relax and have fun, whether you're swimming, playing, or just sunbathing. To talk about beach trips, plan activities, or understand conversations about the sea, it's super helpful to know some common beach vocabulary. From protecting your skin to playing games, there are many words you'll use when heading to the coast!</p>

        <h2>Key Phrases</h2>

        <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
        <div class="grammar-points">
            <h3>1. Present Continuous for Future Plans</h3>
            <p>We often use the <strong>present continuous tense (subject + am/is/are + verb-ing)</strong> to talk about definite plans or arrangements for the near future, especially when a time is mentioned. These are plans that are already decided.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "I'm <strong>bringing</strong> my big beach towel." (Alice has already planned and prepared to bring it.)</li>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "I'm <strong>planning</strong> to collect some seashells." (This is Alice's current plan for the future.)</li>
                <li><em>Structure</em>: Subject + `am/is/are` + Verb-ing + (Time expression)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. "Going to" for Future Intentions/Plans</h3>
            <p>We use <strong>"going to" (subject + am/is/are + going to + base verb)</strong> to express future intentions or plans, often decided before the moment of speaking. It can be very similar to the present continuous for plans.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "Are you <strong>going to try</strong> surfing?" (Bob is asking about Alice's intention.)</li>
                <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "I was thinking of <strong>looking</strong> for some crabs..." (Implies a future intention, could also be "I'm going to look for crabs.")</li>
                <li><em>Structure</em>: Subject + `am/is/are` + `going to` + Base Verb</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> For beginners, both "present continuous" and "going to" can often be used interchangeably for future plans, especially casual ones. Don't worry too much about the subtle differences at first!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Imperatives (Commands & Suggestions)</h3>
            <p>Imperatives are used to give commands, instructions, or make strong suggestions. They usually start with the base form of the verb.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Positive</em>: Start with the base verb.
                    <ul><li><em>Example</em>: "<strong>Be</strong> careful!"</li></ul></li>
                <li><em>Negative</em>: Use "Don't" + base verb.
                    <ul><li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "<strong>Don't forget</strong> the sunscreen!"</li>
                        <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "<strong>Don't let</strong> them pinch you!"</li></ul></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. "Hope" + Clause</h3>
            <p>We use "hope" to express a wish or expectation about something that might happen in the future.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Structure</em>: `Hope + (that) + Subject + Verb` (The word "that" is often optional.)
                    <ul><li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "I just <strong>hope there are some good waves</strong> for my new boogie board."</li>
                        <li><em>Example</em>: "I <strong>hope it doesn't rain</strong> tomorrow."</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
