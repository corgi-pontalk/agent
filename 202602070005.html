    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue">
        <p>Alice: Bob, have you been following the news about international sanctions? My brain feels like it’s trying to decipher a secret alien code.</p>
        <p>Bob: Alice! I know, right? It's like a global game of 'time-out'. Everyone's trying to figure out if it actually works or just makes everyone grumpier.</p>
        <p>Alice: Grumpier is an understatement. One minute they're threatening to <strong>impose sanctions</strong> on an entire industry, the next it's debates about the <strong>humanitarian impact</strong>.</p>
        <p>Bob: Exactly! It's supposed to be <strong>economic leverage</strong>, right? Like when I threaten to stop sharing my pizza with you if you don't stop hogging the remote.</p>
        <p>Alice: That's a <em>bit</em> of an oversimplification, Bob. But does it ever truly <strong>target specific sectors</strong>? Or does it just hit everyone indiscriminately?</p>
        <p>Bob: Well, ideally, they try. But often, there are <strong>unintended consequences</strong>. You aim for the luxury yachts, but hit the fishing boats instead.</p>
        <p>Alice: "Unintended consequences" sounds like a polite way of saying "oops." I read about countries trying to <strong>lift sanctions</strong> after years, only to find the situation hasn't really improved.</p>
        <p>Bob: It's a tough <strong>balancing act</strong>. You want to pressure them towards a <strong>diplomatic solution</strong>, but you don't want to accidentally create a new problem.</p>
        <p>Alice: And everyone’s always talking about the <strong>global economy</strong>. One country sneezes, and suddenly my coffee costs more because of some distant sanction on a bean exporter!</p>
        <p>Bob: Pretty much! It's a <strong>complex issue</strong>. Leaders are always trying to take the <strong>moral high ground</strong> while also protecting their own interests.</p>
        <p>Alice: So, is it more about <strong>soft power</strong> or a <strong>hardline approach</strong>? Or just a really expensive way to feel like you're doing something?</p>
        <p>Bob: Good question! Some argue it’s a necessary tool, a step before military action. Others say it just hurts ordinary people and strengthens defiant regimes.</p>
        <p>Alice: So, no easy answers then. Just lots of economists arguing about spreadsheets and geopolitical chess.</p>
        <p>Bob: Pretty much. Want to impose sanctions on my last cookie for being too delicious?</p>
        <p>Alice: Bob, that's the one sanction I'll never agree with! Let's just eat the cookies and worry about global politics later.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>International sanctions are non-military measures imposed by countries or international bodies against a state, entity, or individual to compel a change in policy or behavior. They are often viewed as a tool of last resort before military intervention, or as a way to exert pressure without direct conflict.</p>
    <p>Currently, debates surrounding international sanctions are multifaceted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Effectiveness</strong>: There's ongoing discussion about whether sanctions truly achieve their policy goals. Critics argue they often fail, sometimes even solidifying authoritarian rule or leading to black markets. Proponents claim they can be effective when carefully designed, targeted, and backed by strong diplomatic efforts.</li>
        <li><strong>Humanitarian Impact</strong>: A significant concern is the "unintended consequences" on civilian populations. While often designed to target specific elites or industries, sanctions can inadvertently lead to shortages of essential goods, inflation, and economic hardship for ordinary citizens, raising ethical questions about collective punishment.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeting and Smart Sanctions</strong>: Efforts are continually made to refine sanctions, making them "smarter" by focusing on specific individuals (travel bans, asset freezes), entities, or sectors (e.g., finance, specific industries) rather than broad embargos that affect an entire economy. The aim is to maximize pressure on decision-makers while minimizing harm to civilians.</li>
        <li><strong>Geopolitical Context</strong>: The use of sanctions is deeply intertwined with global power dynamics. They are frequently used as tools in geopolitical rivalries, leading to accusations of weaponizing the global financial system and prompting sanctioned countries to seek alternative economic alliances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, international sanctions remain a powerful, yet controversial, instrument in international relations, constantly undergoing scrutiny and adaptation.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Impose sanctions</strong>: To officially introduce or enforce restrictions or penalties on a country, organization, or individual.
            <em>Example</em>: The UN Security Council voted to <em>impose sanctions</em> on the rogue state.</li>
        <li><strong>Humanitarian impact</strong>: The effect or consequence of an action on human welfare, especially regarding basic needs like food, water, and health.
            <em>Example</em>: Aid agencies are concerned about the severe <em>humanitarian impact</em> of the ongoing conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic leverage</strong>: The power or advantage gained by using economic means to influence or pressure someone.
            <em>Example</em>: The country used its oil reserves as <em>economic leverage</em> in trade negotiations.</li>
        <li><strong>Target specific sectors</strong>: To direct sanctions or efforts towards particular areas or industries within an economy.
            <em>Example</em>: The new policy aims to <em>target specific sectors</em> like luxury goods and arms manufacturing.</li>
        <li><strong>Unintended consequences</strong>: Outcomes or effects of an action that were not foreseen or planned.
            <em>Example</em>: Raising taxes on sugary drinks had the <em>unintended consequence</em> of people buying cheaper, less healthy alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Lift sanctions</strong>: To remove or terminate restrictions or penalties that were previously imposed.
            <em>Example</em>: There's pressure to <em>lift sanctions</em> on the country to allow humanitarian aid to flow more freely.</li>
        <li><strong>Balancing act</strong>: A situation in which one has to find a compromise or maintain stability between two opposing or difficult things.
            <em>Example</em>: Managing work and family life is often a delicate <em>balancing act</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Diplomatic solution</strong>: A resolution to a conflict or problem achieved through negotiation and discussion between governments or representatives.
            <em>Example</em>: The international community hopes for a <em>diplomatic solution</em> to the crisis.</li>
        <li><strong>Global economy</strong>: The worldwide economic system, encompassing the economic activities of all countries.
            <em>Example</em>: Fluctuations in oil prices can significantly affect the <em>global economy</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex issue</strong>: A problem or subject that has many interconnected parts and is therefore difficult to understand or deal with.
            <em>Example</em>: Climate change is a <em>complex issue</em> requiring global cooperation.</li>
        <li><strong>Moral high ground</strong>: The position of being superior in terms of morality or ethical principles.
            <em>Example</em>: The activist always tried to take the <em>moral high ground</em> in debates about human rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Soft power</strong>: The ability to attract and co-opt rather than coerce, using cultural and political values.
            <em>Example</em>: Cultural exchange programs are a good example of a country using its <em>soft power</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardline approach</strong>: A firm and uncompromising way of dealing with a situation or problem.
            <em>Example</em>: The government adopted a <em>hardline approach</em> against the protestors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Present Perfect Continuous (e.g., "Have you been following...")</h3>
    <p><strong>Form</strong>: <em>has/have + been + verb-ing</em></p>
    <p><strong>Use</strong>: To talk about an action that started in the past and is still continuing now or has recently stopped, with an emphasis on the duration or the ongoing nature of the action.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "Alice: Bob, <strong>have you been following</strong> the news about international sanctions?" (The action of following started in the past and continues up to the present moment.)</li>
        <li><em>Further example</em>: "They <em>have been debating</em> this trade policy for months."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 - Real Conditional)</h3>
    <p><strong>Form</strong>: <em>If + Simple Present, Will + Base Verb</em> (or modal verbs like <em>can, may, might, should</em>)</p>
    <p><strong>Use</strong>: To talk about real and possible situations in the present or future and their likely results. It expresses a strong possibility or certainty.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue (implied)</em>: "Everyone's trying to figure out <strong>if it actually works</strong> or just makes everyone grumpier." (This implies: "If the sanctions work, then X; if they don't, then Y.")</li>
        <li><em>Further example</em>: "If the government <em>imposes</em> stricter sanctions, the economy <em>might suffer</em>."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Passive Voice (e.g., "It's supposed to be...", "sanctions are designed...")</h3>
    <p><strong>Form</strong>: <em>subject + form of 'be' + past participle</em></p>
    <p><strong>Use</strong>: To emphasize the action itself or the recipient of the action rather than the doer of the action, especially when the doer is unknown, unimportant, or obvious from the context. It's very common in formal discussions about policies and international relations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue</em>: "It's <strong>supposed to be</strong> economic leverage..." (Someone 'supposes' it, but the focus is on the expectation of the leverage.)</li>
        <li><em>Example from current situation</em>: "sanctions <strong>are designed</strong> to target specific sectors..." (The designers are not the focus; the design itself is.)</li>
        <li><em>Further example</em>: "New policies <em>were announced</em> by the council yesterday."</li>
    </ul>
