Alice : Hey Bob, ready for our beach trip tomorrow? _Bob_ : Alice! Oh, totally! I've been dreaming of _sand_ , _sun_ , and... well, not getting sunburnt. Alice : Haha, don't forget the _sunscreen_! I'm bringing my big _beach towel_ and a fun inflatable _flamingo_. _Bob_ : A flamingo? Classic Alice! I just hope there are some good _waves_ for my new _boogie board_. Alice : Oh, are you going to try _surfing_? Or just float around near the _shore_? _Bob_ : Definitely floating. Surfing looks like too much work. I just want to relax under a _beach umbrella_ with a cool drink. Alice : Good plan! I'm planning to collect some _seashells_ and maybe even build a _sandcastle_. _Bob_ : A sandcastle? Are you five? I was thinking of looking for some _crabs_ in the _rock pools_. Alice : Hey, sandcastles are an art form! And crabs are sneaky. Don't let them pinch you! _Bob_ : I'll be careful! Do you think we'll see any _fish_ if we go _snorkeling_? Alice : Maybe! I packed my _swimsuit_ and _goggles_. We can definitely try snorkeling. _Bob_ : Awesome! Just promise me you won't make me bury you in the _sand_. My back still hurts from last time. Alice : No promises! But I did bring a _beach ball_. We could play some _volleyball_! _Bob_ : Volleyball sounds fun! Just no burying, deal? Alice : Deal! See you tomorrow, Bob. Don't forget your _flip-flops_! _Bob_ : You too, Alice! And my _sunglasses_!
