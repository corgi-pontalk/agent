        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Hi Bob, you look a bit… dishevelled. Rough morning?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Alice! You have no idea. My bus was late, then I missed my train, and I almost rode a unicycle to work!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> A unicycle? Seriously? Did you actually try?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> No, not seriously! But it felt like the only option left. I even thought about buying roller skates and a cape.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Roller skates and a cape? That&#x2019;s quite a commute! I usually just take the subway. It&#x2019;s fast and cape-free.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Fast? Mine felt like a snail race in slow motion. Do you ever drive?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Sometimes, but parking is a nightmare. And gas is so expensive, my wallet cries.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Tell me about it. I once tried carpooling, but my carpool buddy sang opera at the top of his lungs. Every. Single. Day.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Opera? Oh no! I guess the subway isn&#x2019;t so bad then, even with questionable smells.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Exactly! I&#x2019;m seriously thinking of getting a bicycle. Good for exercise, good for the planet, good for escaping opera.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> That&#x2019;s a great idea! Just watch out for the pigeons. They&#x2019;re very confident cyclists, they don&#x2019;t even use helmets.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> Pigeons? I&#x2019;ll add &#x2018;evade avian cyclists&#x2019; to my list of commute challenges. At least they don&#x2019;t sing opera.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> True! So, bicycle it is then? You might even arrive on time for once!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob:</span> One can dream, Alice. One can dream. Maybe I&#x2019;ll get a helmet with a built-in pigeon deterrent.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice:</span> Good luck with that, Bob! See you later &#x2013; hopefully not on a unicycle!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Transportation is how we move from one place to another. Today, there are many ways to travel, like cars, buses, trains, and bicycles. More people are also using electric vehicles or ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft. While these options offer convenience, cities often face challenges like heavy traffic, pollution, and the cost of fuel. The future of transportation is moving towards more sustainable and smart solutions, like better public transport and electric bikes, to make our journeys easier and greener.</p>
