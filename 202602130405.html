    <h1>Dialogue</h1>

    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, what are you doing? You look very serious today.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Oh, just... contemplating the vastness of existence.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (raising an eyebrow) "Contemplating"? Sounds like you've been watching too many nature documentaries. What deep thought is bothering your brilliant mind?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: It's not bothering! It's <strong>pondering</strong>. I was wondering, what <strong>is</strong> the true meaning of a really good sandwich?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: (laughs) Wow, straight to the <strong>big questions</strong>! That <strong>is</strong> philosophy, isn't it?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Philosophy is asking those big, fundamental questions. Like, why are we even here, buying sandwiches?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, you're a philosopher now? Should I call you Professor Bob the Sandwich Sage?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (grinning) Not professor, but yes, it's about <strong>thinking about things</strong> we usually don't bother with.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Like, "Why is my coffee always cold by the time I remember it exists?" Is that philosophy?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Well, the <strong>existence</strong> of cold coffee could be! But usually, it's more about truth, knowledge, or... why we prefer certain cheeses.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: So, it's not just complaining about small, everyday things, it's complaining about <strong>universal</strong> everyday things?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (chuckles) Sort of! It's trying to understand the <strong>fundamental nature</strong> of... well, everything.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: "Everything"? My everything right now is that my stomach is rumbling. Is there a philosophy for getting a sandwich <strong>faster</strong>?</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: (shrugs dramatically) Perhaps the ethics of queue jumping? But yes, it <strong>makes you think differently</strong> about everything around you.</p>
    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Okay, Professor Bob. Let's apply your philosophy to lunch. What <strong>is</strong> the existential crisis of a forgotten pickle?</p>

    <h1>Current Situation</h1>
    <p>Philosophy might sound like a very academic or difficult subject, but it's actually something we all engage with, often without realizing it! In simple terms, philosophy is about asking fundamental questions about life, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It's not just about finding answers, but also about the process of questioning and critical thinking itself.</p>
    <p>For beginners, understanding philosophy starts with recognizing that curiosity about "why" and "how" we live is a philosophical act. It encourages us to look beyond the obvious and think deeply about common experiences, helping us develop critical thinking skills that are useful in everyday life. So, next time you wonder about the meaning of your breakfast, you're already doing philosophy!</p>

    <h1>Grammar Points</h1>

    <h2>1. Present Simple (for general truths and habits)</h2>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about things that are always true, facts, or regular habits.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Philosophy <strong>is asking</strong> those big questions." (General truth)</li>
        <li>"It <strong>makes</strong> you think differently." (General effect)</li>
        <li>"My stomach <strong>is</strong> rumbling." (Current state/truth)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + Verb (add -s/-es for he/she/it)</p>
    <p class="example-sentence">Example: The sun <strong>rises</strong> in the east. She always <strong>drinks</strong> coffee in the morning.</p>

    <h2>2. Wh-questions (What, Why)</h2>
    <p>We use Wh-questions to ask for specific information. Common Wh-words include What, Why, Where, When, Who, How.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"<strong>What</strong> are you doing?" (Asks about an action)</li>
        <li>"<strong>What</strong> is the true meaning of...?" (Asks for definition/purpose)</li>
        <li>"<strong>Why</strong> are we even here?" (Asks for reason)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Wh-word + auxiliary verb (do/does/is/are/has/have) + subject + main verb?</p>
    <p class="example-sentence">Example: <strong>What</strong> do you like? <strong>Why</strong> is the sky blue?</p>

    <h2>3. Adjectives (to describe things)</h2>
    <p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns (people, places, things, ideas). They add more information about the noun.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"You look very <strong>serious</strong>." (Describes Bob's appearance)</li>
        <li>"Your <strong>brilliant</strong> mind." (Describes Alice's mind)</li>
        <li>"<strong>Big</strong> questions." (Describes the type of questions)</li>
        <li>"<strong>Fundamental</strong> nature." (Describes the type of nature)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adjectives usually come before the noun they describe (e.g., "a <strong>red</strong> car") or after a linking verb like 'be', 'seem', 'look', 'feel' (e.g., "The car is <strong>red</strong>").</p>
    <p class="example-sentence">Example: It was a <strong>beautiful</strong> day. The food tasted <strong>delicious</strong>.</p>
