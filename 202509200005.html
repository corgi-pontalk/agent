    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: Bob, I swear my Wi-Fi just went back to dial-up speeds. I was trying to upload a picture and it took longer than baking a cake!</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Alice, tell me about it! Mine's been so spotty I thought my cat was chewing through the cables again. But honestly, we're complaining about 'slow' internet. Imagine not having any internet at all.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: True. Like, what even is a 'spotty' connection if you don't have a 'connection' in the first place? My friend from back home, she was telling me about her village in a developing nation. They have one community computer for hundreds of people!</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Exactly. That's the digital divide right there. We're grumbling about 5G vs. 4G, and entire communities are struggling to get 1G... or even 0G, if you count no access.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: 0G! Is that a new network standard? Sounds terribly exclusive.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Haha, not quite. It's just my term for absolutely no digital access. Think about all the things we do online â€“ banking, learning, job searching, cat videos...</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: Oh, the cat videos! A world without cat videos is a world I don't want to imagine. But seriously, it affects so much more than just entertainment, right? Education, healthcare information...</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Absolutely. Kids can't do online homework, adults can't apply for jobs or access telehealth. It widens the gap in every aspect of life. It's not just about having a smartphone; it's about reliable infrastructure and affordability.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: So true. I remember when I first got a smartphone, it felt like magic. Now it's just... life. But for many, it's still a luxury. And even if they have one, the data plans can be ridiculously expensive.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Yep, a major barrier. The cost of devices, the cost of data, and then the lack of electricity or even basic digital literacy in some areas. It's a triple threat.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: Triple threat of technological misery! Sounds like a sci-fi movie gone wrong. So, what do you think they're doing about it? Or is it just everyone else getting fibre optic while they're stuck with smoke signals?</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Hopefully not smoke signals! There are initiatives, like satellite internet projects and community Wi-Fi hotspots, even training programs. It's a huge global challenge, but people are working on it.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: That's good to hear. It just feels so unfair. Like, we're over here debating which streaming service has the best interface, and others are just hoping to send an email.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Yeah, it's a stark contrast. Makes you appreciate your 'slow' Wi-Fi a bit more, doesn't it?</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Alice</strong>: Definitely. Maybe I'll stop complaining about my router's existential crisis for a bit. For a few minutes, anyway.</p>
        <p><strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Good luck with that, Alice. I'll believe it when I see it.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>The <strong>digital divide</strong> in developing nations refers to the significant gap in access to and effective use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly the internet, between different populations. While many developed countries enjoy widespread, high-speed connectivity, large parts of the developing world still lack basic access.</p>
    <p>Several factors contribute to this divide: <strong>lack of infrastructure</strong>, especially in rural and remote areas where laying fiber optic cables or building cell towers is costly and difficult; <strong>affordability</strong>, as the cost of internet services, data plans, and digital devices remains prohibitively high for many low-income households; and a lack of <strong>digital literacy</strong>, meaning many people lack the basic skills to use computers or the internet effectively even if access is available.</p>
    <p>The consequences are far-reaching, impacting education (limited access to online learning resources), healthcare (reduced access to telehealth services and health information), economic opportunities (hindered job searching and e-commerce), and social inclusion. Bridging this gap is crucial for global development, leading to various initiatives such as satellite internet projects, public Wi-Fi hotspots, government subsidies for devices, and digital skill training programs.</p>

    <h2>Key Phrases</h2>
    <ul class="key-phrase-list">
        <li><strong>dial-up speeds</strong>: Very slow internet connection, reminiscent of old modems.
            <br><em>Example: "My internet is so slow today, it feels like I'm back on <strong>dial-up speeds</strong>!"</em></li>
        <li><strong>spotty connection</strong>: An unreliable internet connection that frequently disconnects or works intermittently.
            <br><em>Example: "I can't stream anything because of this <strong>spotty connection</strong>; it keeps buffering."</em></li>
        <li><strong>digital divide</strong>: The gap between those who have access to digital technology and those who don't.
            <br><em>Example: "Governments are trying to bridge the <strong>digital divide</strong> by investing in rural internet access."</em></li>
        <li><strong>reliable infrastructure</strong>: Robust and dependable systems, especially for internet and electricity.
            <br><em>Example: "Without <strong>reliable infrastructure</strong>, many remote villages struggle to get online."</em></li>
        <li><strong>affordability</strong>: The state of being inexpensive enough for people to afford.
            <br><em>Example: "The main barrier to smartphone ownership in many areas is often <strong>affordability</strong>."</em></li>
        <li><strong>digital literacy</strong>: The ability to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information using digital technologies.
            <br><em>Example: "Promoting <strong>digital literacy</strong> is essential so people can fully benefit from internet access."</em></li>
        <li><strong>telehealth</strong>: Healthcare services delivered remotely via technology.
            <br><em>Example: "<strong>Telehealth</strong> became vital during the pandemic, but it relies on good internet access."</em></li>
        <li><strong>widen the gap</strong>: To increase the difference between two groups or things.
            <br><em>Example: "Lack of access to education can further <strong>widen the gap</strong> between social classes."</em></li>
        <li><strong>stark contrast</strong>: A very noticeable or distinct difference.
            <br><em>Example: "The wealth of the city in <strong>stark contrast</strong> to the poverty of the rural areas was shocking."</em></li>
        <li><strong>existential crisis</strong> (humorous usage): A period of intense questioning about the meaning and purpose of one's life, used humorously here for inanimate objects.
            <br><em>Example: "My old laptop is having an <strong>existential crisis</strong>; it won't even turn on anymore."</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. "Tell me about it!" (Idiomatic Expression)</h3>
    <p>This phrase is used to express strong agreement, especially when someone is complaining about something you also experience or understand well. It means "I completely agree with you because I've had the same experience."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: Alice, <strong>tell me about it!</strong> Mine's been so spotty I thought my cat was chewing through the cables again."</li>
        <li><em>Another example:</em> "A: This traffic is terrible! B: Tell me about it! I've been stuck here for an hour."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Present Continuous for Ongoing Issues/Complaints</h3>
    <p>We often use the Present Continuous tense (<code>be + -ing verb</code>) to talk about temporary situations, ongoing actions, or repeated actions that are annoying or happening more frequently than usual. It highlights that the action is currently in progress or is a trend over a period.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: But honestly, we<strong>'re complaining</strong> about 'slow' internet." (An ongoing action/complaint at the time of speaking)</li>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: people <strong>are working on</strong> it." (An ongoing effort/initiative)</li>
        <li><em>Another example:</em> "My phone <strong>is constantly crashing</strong> these days." (An annoying, repeated action that is happening now)</li>
        <li><em>Another example:</em> "They <strong>are building</strong> a new school in our neighborhood." (An ongoing project)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Conditional Sentences (Type 1 - Real Conditionals)</h3>
    <p>Type 1 conditional sentences talk about a real or very probable situation in the future or present. The structure is usually: <code>If + Present Simple, will + base form (or imperative)</code> or <code>If + Present Simple, Present Simple</code> for facts or general truths.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Example from dialogue:</em> "<strong class="speaker">Bob</strong>: ...or even 0G, <strong>if you count</strong> no access." (The condition "if you count no access" is presented as a real possibility, and the consequence is implied within the "0G" statement).</li>
        <li><em>Another example:</em> "<strong>If it rains</strong> tomorrow, we <strong>will stay</strong> home." (A real possibility in the future)</li>
        <li><em>Another example:</em> "<strong>If you heat</strong> water to 100 degrees Celsius, it <strong>boils</strong>." (A general truth or scientific fact)</li>
    </ul>
