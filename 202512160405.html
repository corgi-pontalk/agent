    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hi Bob! Great to see you. How are things?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Hey! Things are great, thanks. Just thinking about home. Where are you from again?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: I'm from Australia! Land of sunshine, beaches, and… well, kangaroos!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Kangaroos! Really? Do they just hop down the street like people walk dogs?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: (Laughs) Not quite *down* the street, but you see them in fields and parks! Our national animal is cute, but they can actually box!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Boxing kangaroos! That sounds like an adventure! My country, Canada, is a bit different.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, Canada! Land of maple syrup, politeness, and... snow, right?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Exactly! Lots and lots of snow in winter. We have polar bears too, but they prefer napping to boxing.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Polar bears! Wow. So, is it always cold there?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Not always! We have beautiful, warm summers too. But yes, winter is a big deal. We even have special festivals for snow and ice.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Snow festivals! That's amazing. We have beach festivals. I guess every country has its quirks.</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Definitely! What's your favourite food from Australia?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: Hmmm, Vegemite on toast. It's... unique. You have to try it, but just a tiny bit first!</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Vegemite! I've heard stories. Is it true you need a special guide to eat it properly?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>: You just need to be brave, Bob! What about poutine from Canada?</p>
        <p><span class="speaker">Bob</span>: Poutine! Fries, cheese curds, and gravy. It’s absolutely delicious. No bravery needed, just an empty stomach!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <h3>1. Describing Places with "What's it like...?"</h3>
    <p>We use "What's it like...?" to ask for a general description of a place, person, or thing. The answer usually includes adjectives.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Question</strong>: What's Australia like?</li>
        <li><strong>Answer</strong>: It's sunny and has lots of beaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Question</strong>: What's the weather like in winter?</li>
        <li><strong>Answer</strong>: It's very cold and snowy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Quantifiers: "Lots of," "A bit," "Almost every," "Everywhere"</h3>
    <p>These words help us talk about amounts and frequency.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lots of / Lots and lots of</strong>: A large quantity.
            <br><span class="example-sentence">"We have lots of friends. There are lots and lots of stars tonight."</span></li>
        <li><strong>A bit</strong>: A small amount or degree.
            <br><span class="example-sentence">"It's a bit cold today. The food is a bit spicy."</span></li>
        <li><strong>Almost every</strong>: Indicates something happens or exists nearly all the time or in nearly all cases.
            <br><span class="example-sentence">"It rains almost every day here. Almost every student passed the exam."</span></li>
        <li><strong>Everywhere</strong>: In or to every place. Often used with a little exaggeration for humor.
            <br><span class="example-sentence">"There are trees everywhere in the forest. I see your company's ads everywhere!"</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Modal Verb for Recommendation: "You have to..."</h3>
    <p>"You have to..." is used to express a strong recommendation or a necessity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"You have to try this cake!"</span> (Strong recommendation)</li>
        <li><span class="example-sentence">"You have to study for the test."</span> (Necessity)</li>
    </ul>
