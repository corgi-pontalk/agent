    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, hi Bob! You look a bit... green. Did you have a fun weekend?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Alice! You too. My weekend was an "adventure." I tried glamping. Turns out, 'glamorous camping' still involves dirt and angry squirrels.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Angry squirrels? And here I thought glamping was all about fancy tents and sparkling cider!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Exactly! The website photos showed fluffy beds. My bed was a deflating air mattress. It sounded like a sad whale all night.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Oh, poor Bob! So, no sparkling cider?</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: No, but I did have a very close encounter with a giant mosquito. We shared my tent. He was not a good listener.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Haha! That sounds terrible! My weekend was much simpler. I just binged a new show about a detective cat.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: A detective cat? That sounds way more glamorous than my mosquito roommate.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: It was! He solved mysteries and always landed on his feet. Very impressive.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I just wanted to land on a soft mattress! My back feels like I slept on a stack of encyclopedias.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe next time, try a "staycation." Stay home, relax, order pizza.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Pizza and no mosquitoes? That sounds like a dream! I'm taking notes.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good idea! And remember, 'glamping' is a trap, unless you love nature... and pain.</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: Lesson learned, Alice. Hard. My next trip will be to my couch.</p>
        <p><strong>Alice</strong>: Perfect! See you next week, hopefully well-rested!</p>
        <p><strong>Bob</strong>: I'll try my best! Bye!</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Weekend trips are short vacations that people take, usually on Saturdays and Sundays. They are very popular because they offer a quick escape from daily routines like work or school without needing a lot of planning or time off. People enjoy weekend trips to relax, explore new places, visit friends or family, or try new activities. Some prefer quiet getaways in nature, while others like exciting city breaks or a mix of both. It's a great way to recharge and experience something different in a short amount of time, making Monday mornings feel a little less distant!</p>

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>
    <div class="grammar-point">
        <h3>1. The Simple Past Tense</h3>
        <p>We use the Simple Past Tense to talk about actions that happened and finished at a specific time in the past.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular verbs</strong> usually add <strong>-ed</strong>:
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I <strong>tried</strong> glamping." (from "try")</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "My back feels like I <strong>slept</strong> on a stack of encyclopedias." (from "sleep")</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Irregular verbs</strong> change their form:
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "My weekend <strong>was</strong> an 'adventure'." (from "be")</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "We <strong>shared</strong> my tent." (from "share")</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I just <strong>binged</strong> a new show." (from "binge")</p>
            </li>
            <li>To make it negative, use <strong>did not (didn't) + base form of the verb</strong>:
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "I <strong>didn't enjoy</strong> the bugs."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Adjectives</h3>
        <p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns (people, places, things, ideas). They tell us more about the noun.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the dialogue, you saw:
                <p class="example-sentence">"You look a bit <strong>green</strong>." (describes Bob's appearance)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">"<strong>angry</strong> squirrels" (describes the squirrels)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">"<strong>fancy</strong> tents" (describes the tents)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">"a <strong>giant</strong> mosquito" (describes the mosquito)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">"a <strong>detective</strong> cat" (describes the cat's role)</p>
            </li>
            <li>Adjectives usually come before the noun they describe, or after verbs like "be" (is, am, are, was, were), "look," "feel," "sound."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. "To look" + Adjective (for appearance)</h3>
        <p>We use "look" followed by an adjective to describe someone's appearance or how they seem.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure: Subject + look/looks + adjective</strong>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "You <strong>look tired</strong>." (You seem tired.)</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "He <strong>looks happy</strong> today."</p>
                <p class="example-sentence">Example: "The food <strong>looks delicious</strong>."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
