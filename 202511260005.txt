Alice: Oh, hey Bob, you look chipper. I'm over here contemplating my life choices.
Bob: Alice! What's got you down? Did your favourite coffee shop run out of oat milk again?
Alice: Worse. I just spent an hour looking at apartment listings in Singapore. My future home might just be a very fancy cardboard box, or maybe a really luxurious tent.
Bob: Haha, tell me about it! The real estate market in Asia is absolutely bonkers right now. Especially places like Seoul and Tokyo. It's like houses are made of gold bricks.
Alice: "Bonkers" is an understatement. I saw a studio flat in Hong Kong that was basically a glorified shoe box for the price of a small island. Complete with a miniature kitchen that fits one noodle cup.
Bob: It's like property values are operating on a different planet. Is it all foreign investment driving it, do you think? Or perhaps magical leprechauns buying up everything?
Alice: Partially, yeah. And low interest rates in some places. Everyone's scrambling to get a piece of the pie before it's completely out of reach for us mere mortals.
Bob: I heard somewhere that even in cities like Bangkok, prices for prime locations are skyrocketing. Makes you wonder if there's a bubble forming, ready to burst spectacularly.
Alice: Definitely feels like it. I mean, who can afford these places? Not us, that's for sure. My dream of a spacious apartment with a balcony is slowly morphing into a shared bunk bed in a co-living space, if I'm lucky.
Bob: Don't give up! Maybe we should start a trend: micro-living in a refurbished shipping container. Very eco-chic, and probably still unaffordable.
Alice: Or just buy a tiny island somewhere in the Pacific. Cheaper, better views... until the rising sea levels make it disappear. Then it's an underwater investment.
Bob: I'm serious, though. It's tough for our generation. My parents bought their first house for less than my current student loan debt! They practically got a palace for pennies.
Alice: Right? It's a whole different ballgame. I just wish there was some stability, some... *affordability*. A magical unicorn that makes house prices reasonable.
Bob: Well, if all else fails, I've heard the moon has excellent long-term investment potential. No capital gains tax yet! And the views are out of this world.
Alice: (Sighs dramatically) Bob, sometimes I wonder if you're trying to make me laugh or cry. Let's just go get some coffee and pretend we own a skyscraper in the most exclusive part of Tokyo.
