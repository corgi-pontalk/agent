Alice: Bob, what's all this mess? Are you building a mountain of laundry?
Bob: Oh, hi Alice! No, I'm trying to find my keys... and maybe some socks. I think I have five feet of dirty clothes here!
Alice: Five feet? Bob, you only have two feet! And I see at least three shoes under that pile. Are these all yours?
Bob: Hmm, maybe some socks are missing their partners. And those shoes... they're like wild animals. I also found two mice in my cupboard last week!
Alice: Mice? Plural of mouse? You need to clean more often! What else did you find?
Bob: Well, I found three pens and two pencils under my bed. And look, these are my old toys! I have five toy cars and two action figures.
Alice: Wow, a treasure hunt! Did you find any books? I lent you three books last month.
Bob: Oh, yes! Your books are on the shelf. Near my collection of rocks. I have many rocks from the beach.
Alice: Rocks are nice. But what about your plates and glasses? I see some dirty plates from last week.
Bob: Oops. Those are just two plates. And three glasses. I'll wash them. I promise!
Alice: And what about these? Are these potatoes or small rocks? They look suspiciously similar.
Bob: Haha, those are potatoes! I was going to make fries. But I also have three tomatoes for a salad.
Alice: You have so many things! And speaking of things, did you find your keys?
Bob: My keys! Oh no, I totally forgot! This room has too many objects.
Alice: Let's find those keys! And maybe some clean clothes for you, too.
