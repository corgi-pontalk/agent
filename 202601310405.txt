Alice: Bob, this commercial is playing for the tenth time today! My TV knows I hate this brand.
Bob: (chuckles) Alice, it's not just your TV. Ads are everywhere! Look at my phone, another pop-up ad for cat food. I don't even have a cat!
Alice: Exactly! They follow us. Yesterday, I looked at a pair of shoes online for five seconds, and now every website shows me those shoes. It’s like they're haunting me.
Bob: Oh, I know that feeling! It’s like a digital ghost. Do you think they actually work?
Alice: Well, sometimes. I did buy that super soft blanket after seeing a cute animal in the ad. It was very persuasive.
Bob: Ha! So you're saying ads are evil _but_ effective?
Alice: Maybe a little. Especially those funny ones. Remember the ad with the talking baby selling insurance? That was hilarious.
Bob: Oh, yes! That baby was a marketing genius. I almost called them!
Alice: See? Humor can make an ad memorable. But most of them are just... loud.
Bob: True. And repetitive. I wish there was an "ad mute" button for real life.
Alice: Or an "ad skip" button for billboards. Imagine driving without seeing a giant burger!
Bob: (laughs) A peaceful drive! But then how would we know about new burgers? It's a tricky balance.
Alice: Maybe. But I think I prefer fewer burgers and more peace.
Bob: So, no more cute animal ads for you?
Alice: Okay, _some_ cute animal ads are allowed. They're an exception!
