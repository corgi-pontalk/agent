        <h2>Dialogue</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-box">
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey Bob, you look like you just finished a K-drama marathon. Are those eye bags or dramatic shadows?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Alice! You caught me. I just <span class="highlight">binged</span> 'Squid Game 2: The Ramen Debt'. It's intense!</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Squid Game 2? I thought the original was enough to give me nightmares.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Oh, this one's different! It's about a character trying to pay off their instant noodle debt. Surprisingly gripping.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Sounds... delicious? So, what's with the obsession with Korean culture lately? Everywhere I look, it's BTS or Blackpink.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It's not 'lately', Alice, it's a <span class="highlight">global phenomenon</span>! K-pop, K-dramas, K-beauty, K-food... it's all just <span class="highlight">chef's kiss</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Okay, 'chef's kiss' for a culture? You're really into it. <span class="highlight">Have you tried making</span> your own kimchi yet?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Don't tempt me! My apartment already smells vaguely of garlic and ambition. But I did <span class="highlight">nail the tteokbokki</span> last week.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Tteokbokki? The spicy rice cakes? I tried that once, nearly <span class="highlight">set my mouth on fire</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> That's the beauty of it! The spice, the chewiness... it's an experience. You know, I'm even learning some Korean phrases.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> Jinja? Really? So, if I ask you to 'annyeonghaseyo' me, you'd understand?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Of course! Annyeonghaseyo, Alice! See? And 'kamsahamnida' for teaching me. It's <span class="highlight">surprisingly intuitive</span>.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You're getting <span class="highlight">dangerously close</span> to booking a flight to Seoul, aren't you?</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> Maybe! But first, I need to master the 'finger heart'. It's essential for blending in.</p>
            <p><strong>Alice:</strong> You're hilarious, Bob. Maybe I'll join you for some K-BBQ sometime. You can practice your 'Oppa!' on the waiter.</p>
            <p><strong>Bob:</strong> It's a date! But I'll stick to 'jeogiyo' for the waiter. 'Oppa' is more for... a K-drama moment.</p>

        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>Korean culture, often referred to as the "Korean Wave" or "Hallyu," has seen an explosive surge in global popularity over the past few decades. This phenomenon encompasses various aspects, including K-pop (Korean pop music) with groups like BTS and Blackpink achieving unprecedented international success, K-dramas (Korean television series) captivating audiences worldwide with their compelling storylines, and Korean cinema gaining critical acclaim (e.g., "Parasite" winning Best Picture at the Oscars). Beyond entertainment, K-beauty products have become highly sought after, and Korean cuisine, such as kimchi, bulgogi, and tteokbokki, has found its way into kitchens and restaurants across continents. This widespread appeal is attributed to its unique blend of tradition and modernity, high production quality, and relatable themes, fostering a vibrant global community of fans and enthusiasts.</p>

        <div class="grammar-points">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Present Perfect (for experiences)</strong>
                    <p>The Present Perfect tense is often used to talk about experiences or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past, or actions that started in the past and continue to the present. It emphasizes the result or the fact that something has occurred, rather than when it occurred.</p>
                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Subject + has/have + past participle</p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "Have you <span class="highlight">tried making</span> your own kimchi yet?"</em> (Asking about a past experience)</p>
                    <p><em>Another example: "I have <span class="highlight">visited</span> Korea twice."</em> (An experience at an unspecified time in the past)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adverbs Modifying Adjectives and Other Adverbs</strong>
                    <p>Adverbs can modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. In the dialogue, you see adverbs modifying adjectives to intensify or qualify their meaning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Adverb + Adjective</p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "It's <span class="highlight">surprisingly intuitive</span>."</em> ('Surprisingly' modifies the adjective 'intuitive', indicating an unexpected quality.)</p>
                    <p><em>Example from dialogue: "You're getting <span class="highlight">dangerously close</span> to booking a flight to Seoul."</em> ('Dangerously' modifies the adjective 'close', emphasizing the intensity of the proximity.)</p>
                    <p>This construction adds nuance and specific detail to descriptions.</p>
