Alice: Oh, Bob! Fancy meeting you here. What a surprise!
Bob: Alice! You look like you just wrestled a shopping cart and won. What's in the bags?
Alice: Haha, very funny. I just went on a little shopping spree at the mall. My wallet is crying!
Bob: A 'little' spree? Those bags look heavy. Did you buy everything?
Alice: Not everything, but I found some great deals! Look, I got this amazing new sweater.
Bob: Hmm, nice pattern. How much was it?
Alice: It was originally50, but it was on sale for 30% off! What a bargain!
Bob: Wow, that's a good discount. Did you try it on?
Alice: Of course! The fitting room was a bit crowded, but it's the perfect size. It fits like a glove!
Bob: Good. Anything else interesting that drained your bank account?
Alice: Oh, yes! A new pair of comfy sneakers and a funny mug for my morning coffee.
Bob: Sounds like a very successful trip. Did you pay with cash or card?
Alice: Card. And I made sure to get the receipt in case I need to return anything. You never know!
Bob: Smart thinking. My wallet feels lighter just hearing about your shopping!
Alice: Don't worry, Bob. Next time, we can go window shopping together and just look! No money needed!
