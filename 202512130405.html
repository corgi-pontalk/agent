    <h2>Dialogue</h2>
    <div class="dialogue-box">
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Hey Bob, what do you think of my new outfit? I call it "Cloudy with a chance of sparkles!"</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Alice! Wow, that's... certainly <i>you</i>. Is that a rainbow scarf with polka-dot pants?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: It is! And these are my new astronaut boots. Very practical for walking on clouds, you know.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: I can imagine. You always have such <span class="key-phrase-bold">unique fashion sense</span>. My style is more "comfy couch potato."</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Come on, Bob! You look great in your simple t-shirts and jeans. It's <span class="key-phrase-bold">classic</span>!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Thanks, Alice. But your clothes are always so <span class="key-phrase-bold">colorful and bold</span>! Do you <span class="key-phrase-bold">follow fashion trends</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Sometimes! But I mostly <span class="key-phrase-bold">wear what makes me happy</span>. Today, I feel like a happy cloud!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: A very shiny, happy cloud. So, are these boots <span class="key-phrase-bold">in fashion now</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Maybe not <i>yet</i>, but they will be! I'm a <span class="key-phrase-bold">trendsetter</span>, Bob.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: Right, a trendsetter. My fashion goal is just to match my socks. It's a struggle.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Haha! Matching socks is a good start. What about for a party? Do you <span class="key-phrase-bold">dress up</span>?</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: For a party? Yes, I try. Maybe a clean t-shirt. Sometimes even a shirt with buttons!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Oh, fancy! Well, your "comfy couch potato" look works for you, Bob. It's <span class="key-phrase-bold">authentic</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Bob</span>: And your "Cloudy with a chance of sparkles" look is definitely authentic too, Alice!</p>
        <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Alice</span>: Exactly! <span class="key-phrase-bold">Fashion is fun</span>.</p>

    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
    <p>Fashion today is all about expressing yourself! There are no strict rules.

Social media makes it easy to see new ideas from all over the world, so many people find inspiration online.

    <h2>Grammar Points</h2>

    <h3>1. <span class="grammar-point-bold">Present Simple</span> (for habits, general truths, and opinions)</h3>
    <p>We use the Present Simple to talk about things that happen regularly, are generally true, or to express opinions and facts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Habit/Regular Action:</b> "You <i>always have</i> such unique fashion sense." (Bob observes this about Alice regularly.)</li>
        <li><b>General Truth/Fact:</b> "It <i>is</i> classic!" (This is a widely accepted statement about the style.)</li>
        <li><b>Opinion/Preference:</b> "I mostly <i>wear</i> what makes me happy." (This is Alice's usual choice.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>How to form:</b><br>
    I / You / We / They + <b>verb (base form)</b><br>
    He / She / It + <b>verb + -s / -es</b></p>
    <p class="example-sentence"><i>I <b>like</b> colorful clothes. She <b>likes</b> colorful clothes.</i></p>

    <h3>2. <span class="grammar-point-bold">Adjectives for Description</span></h3>
    <p>Adjectives describe nouns (people, places, things, ideas). They tell us more about their qualities, size, color, etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Examples from dialogue:</b> <br>
            <i><b>new</b> outfit, <b>rainbow</b> scarf, <b>polka-dot</b> pants, <b>astronaut</b> boots, <b>practical</b>, <b>unique</b> fashion sense, <b>comfy</b> couch potato, <b>simple</b> t-shirts, <b>classic</b>, <b>colorful</b> and <b>bold</b>, <b>happy</b> cloud, <b>shiny</b>, <b>clean</b> t-shirt, <b>fancy</b>, <b>authentic</b>.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adjectives usually come <b>before</b> the noun they describe (e.g., <i>a <b style="color:red;">red</b> car</i>) or <b>after</b> the verb "to be" (e.g., <i>The car <b style="color:red;">is red</b></i>).</p>
    <p class="example-sentence"><i>Alice's clothes are very <b style="color:blue;">colorful</b>. This is a <b style="color:blue;">nice</b> shirt.</i></p>

    <h3>3. <span class="grammar-point-bold">Verb "To Be"</span> (is, am, are)</h3>
    <p>The verb "to be" is very common. We use it to describe things, people, and situations, or to state facts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>I am:</b> "I <i>am</i> a trendsetter."</li>
        <li><b>You are / We are / They are:</b> "These <i>are</i> my new astronaut boots." "Your clothes <i>are</i> always so colorful."</li>
        <li><b>He is / She is / It is:</b> "It <i>is</i> classic!" "Fashion <i>is</i> fun."</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="example-sentence"><i>My style <b>is</b> simple. You <b>are</b> very stylish. We <b>are</b> friends.</i></p>
