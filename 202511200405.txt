Alice : Hey Bob, what are you looking at so seriously? Bob : Oh, hi Alice! I'm planning my next trip! But I'm stuck. Alice : A trip? Anywhere exciting? Tell me! Bob : I want to see a famous tourist attraction, but I always end up at the most crowded, weirdest places. Alice : Haha, I know! Remember that time we went to see the "World's Largest Ball of Yarn"? Bob : Oh, don't remind me! My allergies started acting up from all the dust! It looked much bigger in the pictures. Alice : And you insisted! "It's a landmark, Alice! A marvel of human creativity!" you said. Bob : Well, it *was* a landmark. Just a very... fluffy one. So, what do you think is a good tourist spot? Alice : Hmm, how about something really grand, like the Pyramids of Giza? No dust there, just sand! Bob : Sand? And stairs? Bob's knees say "no thanks." Maybe something less... climbable. Alice : You're impossible! How about a beautiful beach then? With clear water? Bob : A beach! Yes! With no giant yarn balls, and maybe a famous sandcastle that stays put! Alice : A famous sandcastle? Bob, you're hilarious. But a beach sounds nice. Let's find one! Bob : Perfect! But no more giant fruit statues, please. My fruit phobia developed after that banana incident. Alice : You have a fruit phobia now? Bob, you're truly a unique tourist. Let's go!
