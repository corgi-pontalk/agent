Alice : Bob, what trouble have you gotten into *now*? You look like you've just wrestled a clothes rack. Bob : Alice! Not trouble, enlightenment! I've officially joined the minimalist movement. Just spent the morning trying to declutter my apartment. Alice : Declutter? Bob, last week you bought a 'vintage' Hawaiian shirt you swore was essential for your 'ironic fashion phase'. Bob : Past Bob was a maximalist in denial. Present Bob is free! I'm embracing the 'less is more ' philosophy. My apartment feels so spacious! Alice : Spacious, or just... empty? Are you going to sit on the floor and meditate now? Bob : Maybe! Think of the mental clarity! No more decision fatigue from choosing which identical black t-shirt to wear. Alice : But what about your comic book collection? And your twenty different types of hot sauce? Those aren't exactly 'minimalist'. Bob : Ah, the 'joy-sparking items '! I'm still figuring out the fine print. The hot sauces are clearly essential. And the comics... well, they bring *immense* joy. Alice : Right. So, it's 'minimalist' unless it's something you really, really like. Sounds like my diet plan. Bob : Hey, it's a journey! I did manage to get rid of that novelty singing fish. That was a big step. Alice : The one Aunt Carol gave you? That's practically a family heirloom! You're brave. Bob : Or foolish, time will tell. But seriously, it's actually quite liberating. I feel lighter. Alice : I don't know, Bob. My entire life is currently crammed into a very small apartment. Maybe I could start with just one drawer. Or just not buying *another* plant. Bob : See! That's the spirit! One drawer today, world domination tomorrow! Alice : Let's stick to decluttering. World domination sounds like a lot of stuff to acquire.
