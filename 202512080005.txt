Alice: Bob, did you hear about the Tokyo Marathon 2025?
Bob: Alice, I did! My social media is already buzzing with "I'm training for it!" posts. Like, really?
Alice: Tell me about it. I saw a guy post about his 'long run' being 5k. I nearly choked on my coffee.
Bob: Hey, 5k is a start! For *some* people. Me, I'm just looking forward to the epic costumes.
Alice: Ah, the costume runners! They're definitely a highlight. Remember the guy dressed as a giant sushi roll?
Bob: How could I forget? He was practically rolling himself across the finish line. I bet his soy sauce dipping station was a hit.
Alice: You'd think they'd trip. But no, they power through. What are you actually looking forward to, Bob? The elite runners breaking records?
Bob: Honestly? The drama. Will someone bonk spectacularly? Will there be a surprise underdog winner? It's like a live-action sports soap opera.
Alice: You're terrible! But true, the stories are always gripping. I'm excited to see if they introduce any new tech or course changes.
Bob: Oh, definitely. Imagine if they had a giant conveyor belt for the last 5k. Instant personal bests for everyone!
Alice: That defeats the purpose, you couch potato! But a massage station at the 30k mark? Now *that* I could get behind.
Bob: Genius! Or maybe a ramen stand at the halfway point. Fueling up in style.
Alice: You're just thinking with your stomach, as usual. I'm more curious about the atmosphere. The crowds are always incredible.
Bob: That's it, Alice! The energy from the spectators is infectious. Even if you're just watching from your sofa, you feel it.
Alice: Exactly. It's truly one of the biggest spectacles in Tokyo. Maybe we should go watch it live this time?
Bob: Only if you promise to hold my ramen for me while I cheer. My arms get tired.
Alice: Deal! But you're buying the ramen.
