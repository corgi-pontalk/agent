Alice: Bob, you look like you've seen a ghost. What's up?
Bob: Alice, it's worse than a ghost. It's... presentation day tomorrow!
Alice: Oh no! The dreaded PowerPoint monster!
Bob: Exactly! My slides are more confused than I am.
Alice: Did you practice? Even just in front of your cat?
Bob: My cat just yawned and walked away. Not a great audience.
Alice: Maybe try looking at the back wall, not people's faces. It helps with nerves.
Bob: But what if the back wall judges me?
Alice: The back wall is notoriously forgiving. Just speak clearly.
Bob: I tend to mumble when I'm nervous. Like a very quiet, scared squirrel.
Alice: Remember to smile! Even if it feels fake.
Bob: A fake smile? I might look like I'm trying to sell something I don't believe in.
Alice: Just imagine everyone is wearing silly hats. It works for me!
Bob: Silly hats... Okay, I'll try it. Wish me luck, Alice.
Alice: Good luck, Bob! Don't forget your imaginary hat-wearing audience!
