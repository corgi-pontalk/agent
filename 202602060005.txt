Alice : Bob, you wouldn't _believe_ what happened at the supermarket today! My favorite brand of fancy French cheese was completely gone! And the prices, oh my goodness! Bob : Let me guess, Alice, you’re blaming Brexit again, aren't you? It's always something with you! Alice : Well, _obviously_! It's one of Brexit's long-term consequences, isn't it? Everything feels more complicated, and my cheese supply is a national emergency! Bob : (chuckles) Your cheese supply is hardly a national emergency. But I get what you mean. The paperwork for importing seems to have gone through the roof, even for a block of Stilton, let alone Brie. Alice : Exactly! And remember how easy it was to just hop over to Paris for a weekend trip? Now, passports need stamping, and there are more hoops to jump through than an agility dog competition. Bob : True. The whole travel thing definitely feels a bit clunkier. My cousin tried to send a parcel to his friend in Germany last month, and it ended up costing him an arm and a leg, plus it got stuck in customs for ages. Alice : See? It’s not just my cheese! It's the small things that really add up. Like finding staff for hospitality – everyone I know in catering says it's a nightmare. Bob : Yeah, the labor market definitely took a hit in certain sectors. Farmers too, apparently. My uncle runs a small farm, and he's struggling to find seasonal workers like never before. Alice : It's almost like we didn't quite foresee _all_ the ripple effects, is it? We were promised sunlit uplands, and I'm still waiting for my ray of sunshine. Bob : Well, economic models are tricky, aren't they? It's not just about trade deals; it's about supply chains, regulations, and all the invisible strings that hold things together. Alice : Invisible strings that are now tangled up like my headphones! And what about all the promises of cutting red tape? I feel like I'm drowning in more red tape than ever. Bob : (nods slowly) You've got a point there. Some argue it’s just the transition phase, but it does feel like the bureaucratic burden has increased in many areas rather than decreased. Alice : So, my fancy cheese might never return to its former glory? This is truly devastating, Bob. Truly devastating. Bob : Maybe we just need to adapt and find new British cheeses, Alice. There's some excellent cheddar out there! Alice : (sighs dramatically) It's just not the same, Bob. It's just not the same.
